cv-valid-test/sample-000070.mp3,HE FELT INVISIBLE AMONG ALL THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE
cv-valid-test/sample-000071.mp3,HE THOUGHT OF ALL THE MARRIED SHEPHERDS HE HAD KNOWN
cv-valid-test/sample-000072.mp3,DID YOU MEAN SPICE AND THINGS LIKE THAT
cv-valid-test/sample-000073.mp3,BUT FINALLY THE MERCHANT APPEARED AND ASKED THE BOY TO SHARE FULL SHEEP

cv-valid-test/sample-000081.mp3,IT'S CANVAS NO AN LONG DISTANCE FROM WASHINGTON
cv-valid-test/sample-000082.mp3,HE COULD ALWAYS GO BACK TO BEING A SHEPHERD
cv-valid-test/sample-000083.mp3,THE BOY WENT TO HIS ROOM AND PECKED HIS BELONGINGS
cv-valid-test/sample-000084.mp3,DID YOU KNOW THAT
cv-valid-test/sample-000085.mp3,THEY WENT IN TO DRINK THE TEA WHICH WAS SERVED IN BEAUTIFUL CRYSTAL GLASSES
cv-valid-test/sample-000086.mp3,THIS IS FOR YOU
cv-valid-test/sample-000087.mp3,THERE WERE MEN OF THE DESERT AND THEY WERE FEARFUL OF SORCERERS
cv-valid-test/sample-000088.mp3,THEIR FACES WERE HIDDEN BEHIND BLUE VEILS WITH ONLY THEIR EYES SHOWING
cv-valid-test/sample-000089.mp3,IT SEEMED SO SAFE AND TRANQUIL

cv-valid-test/sample-000096.mp3,I HEARD A FAINT MOVEMENT INTO MY FEET
cv-valid-test/sample-000097.mp3,HE STOOD IRRESOLUTE FOR A MOMENT AND THEN SCRAMBLED OUT OF THE PIT
cv-valid-test/sample-000098.mp3,EVEN THEN HE HARDLY UNDERSTOOD WHAT THIS MEANT
cv-valid-test/sample-000099.mp3,IT LOOKED LIKE A RUSTY GAS FLUTE
cv-valid-test/sample-000100.mp3,IT KNEW OF THE BOY'S TALK WITH THE DESERT BECAUSE THE WINDS KNOW EVERYTHING
cv-valid-test/sample-000101.mp3,ALL THEY THINK ABOUT IS FOOD AND WATER

cv-valid-test/sample-000106.mp3,SURE YOU DON'T WANT ME TO GO IN WITH YOU
cv-valid-test/sample-000107.mp3,I WANT IT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
cv-valid-test/sample-000108.mp3,IT LOOKED LIKE A RISTIGAS SLOAT
cv-valid-test/sample-000109.mp3,SOME STRONGED WEREWORTH O ECTENTION
cv-valid-test/sample-000110.mp3,IT WAS AS IF IT QUAVERED BUT REALLY THIS WAS THE TELESCOPE VIBRATING

cv-valid-test/sample-000113.mp3,IMAGE REGISTRATION COULD BE EASILY INCORPORATED INTO LOW POWER EMBEDDED DEVICES
cv-valid-test/sample-000114.mp3,THE MERCHANTS WERE ASSEMBLING THEIR STALLS AND THE BOY HELPED A CANDECELLAR TO DO HIS

cv-valid-test/sample-000130.mp3,THEY WENT ON SMOKING THE PIPE FOR A WHILE AS THE SUN BEGAN TO SET

cv-valid-test/sample-000371.mp3,THE ALCHEMIST DISMOUNTED SLOWLY AND THE BOY DID THE SAME
cv-valid-test/sample-000372.mp3,HE STARTED TO READ THE BOOK HE HAD BOUGHT
cv-valid-test/sample-000373.mp3,THE TOP HAD SUDDENLY CEASED TO ROTATE
cv-valid-test/sample-000374.mp3,ONE KEY IS FOR INCRYPTION THE OTHER ONE FOR DECRYPTION
cv-valid-test/sample-000375.mp3,HE CAME TO UNDERSTAND ITS DODGES AND TRICKS AND TO ACCEPT IT AS IT WAS
cv-valid-test/sample-000376.mp3,MAYBE SHE DIDN'T EVEN REMEMBER HIM
cv-valid-test/sample-000377.mp3,I'M NEVER MORE AWARE OF A ROOM'S ACCOUSTICS THAN WHEN I'M TRYING TO ENJOY A SNACK I HAVE NO INTENTION OF SHARING

cv-valid-test/sample-000404.mp3,HE NEEDED SOMEONE TO TALK TO HER SO AS TO AVOID THINKING ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF WAR
cv-valid-test/sample-000405.mp3,THEN THE THING CAME UPON HIM IN A FLASH
cv-valid-test/sample-000406.mp3,IT WAS THE PURE LANGUAGE OF THE WORLD
cv-valid-test/sample-000407.mp3,HE KNEW HOW TO SHEAR THEM AND HOW TO SLAUGHTER THEM

cv-valid-test/sample-000410.mp3,THE BOY WAS GETTING IRRITATED
cv-valid-test/sample-000411.mp3,WHENEVER HE SAW THE SEA OR A FIRE HE FELL SILENT IMPRESSED BY THEIR ELEMENTAL FORCE
cv-valid-test/sample-000412.mp3,THE BOY WAITED AND THEN INTERRUPTED THE OLD MAN JUST AS HE HIMSELF HAD BEEN INTERRUPTED
cv-valid-test/sample-000413.mp3,THE LOAFERS AND GOLF CUDDIES WERE USED TO HANGING OUT NEAR THE RAILWAY STATION
cv-valid-test/sample-000414.mp3,I MYSELF HEARD NOTHING OF THAT
cv-valid-test/sample-000415.mp3,AND THE SAND AND GRAVEL HAD BEEN FLUNG VIOLENTLY IN EVERY DIRECTION
cv-valid-test/sample-000416.mp3,AND HE WASN'T FARING MUCH BETTER
cv-valid-test/sample-000417.mp3,NOW I'M BEGINNING WHAT I COULD HAVE STARTED TEN YEARS AGO
cv-valid-test/sample-000418.mp3,WHEN THE SEAMOON CEASED TO BLOW EVERYONE LOOKED TO THE PLACE WHERE THE BOY HAD BEEN

cv-valid-test/sample-000420.mp3,IN SPITE OF THIS I STILL BELIEVED THAT THERE WERE MEN IN MARS
cv-valid-test/sample-000421.mp3,IT SEEMED AS IF WHAT THE OLD KING HAD CALLED BEGINNA'S LUCK WERE NO LONGER FUNCTIONING
cv-valid-test/sample-000422.mp3,DOWN BELOW IN THE DARKNESS WERE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE SLEEPING IN PEACE
cv-valid-test/sample-000423.mp3,AND TO DO THAT YOU NEED MONEY
cv-valid-test/sample-000424.mp3,YOU SHOULD SEE HIS FAN MAIL

cv-valid-test/sample-000445.mp3,THERE WAS VERY LITTLE TALKING
cv-valid-test/sample-000446.mp3,AND IN THAT WAY THE MONTHS PASSED
cv-valid-test/sample-000447.mp3,TO NURISH THE FALCON
cv-valid-test/sample-000448.mp3,THIS WAS THE STRANGEST OF ALL THINGS THAT EVER CAME TO EARTH FROM OUTER SPACE

cv-valid-test/sample-000457.mp3,HE WAS TWENTY MINUTES FROM HIS TENT AND BEGAN TO MAKE HIS WAY THERE
cv-valid-test/sample-000458.mp3,IT LOOKED LIKE A RUSTY GAS FLOAT
cv-valid-test/sample-000459.mp3,IT WAS HOWEVER STILL SO HOT FROM ITS FLIGHT THROUGH THE AIR
cv-valid-test/sample-000460.mp3,CAN I GET A WOOT WOOT

cv-valid-test/sample-000463.mp3,THE BOY PICKED UP HIS POUCH AND PUT IT WITH HIS OTHER THINGS
cv-valid-test/sample-000464.mp3,THE DAY WAS DAWNING AND THE SHEPHERD URGED HIS SHEEP IN THE DIRECTION OF THE SUN

cv-valid-test/sample-000476.mp3,I THOUGHT ABOUT WHETHER WE SHOULD FIND COINS AND MODELS IN IT AND SE ON
cv-valid-test/sample-000477.mp3,THEY RETURNED TO THE GATES OF THE MONASTERY
cv-valid-test/sample-000478.mp3,THE OLD MAN WAS PROBABLY A GYPSY TOO
cv-valid-test/sample-000479.mp3,AND ED KNEW NOTHING ABOUT LOVE

cv-valid-test/sample-000508.mp3,DID YOU GET THE MAYOR
cv-valid-test/sample-000509.mp3,THEY SAID NOTHING ELSE
cv-valid-test/sample-000510.mp3,IT WAS GLARINGLY HOT NOT A CLOUD IN THE SKY NOR A BREATH OF WIND
cv-valid-test/sample-000511.mp3,IT WAS ALMOST AS IF HE HAD BEEN HERE AND LEFT HIS MARK HE TALKED
cv-valid-test/sample-000512.mp3,WHY DO YOU WANT TO FIND THAT SORT OF PERSON THE ARAB ASKED
cv-valid-test/sample-000513.mp3,THE STRANGER SEEMED SATISFIED WITH THE ANSWER
cv-valid-test/sample-000514.mp3,YOU'LL BE READY IN TIME
cv-valid-test/sample-000515.mp3,I THOUGHT ABOUT WHETHER WE SHOULD FIND COINS AND MODELS IN IT AND SO ON
cv-valid-test/sample-000516.mp3,I WANT TO TELL YOU A STORY ABOUT DREAMS SAID THE ALCHEMIST
cv-valid-test/sample-000517.mp3,EXCEPT FOR THE DREAM
cv-valid-test/sample-000518.mp3,I JUST DON'T TRUST ANYONE WHO SAYS THEY'VE NEVER HAD HAMBURGER HELPER
cv-valid-test/sample-000519.mp3,DURING SISSEARTH HERE THE OMENS WILL CONTINUE TO SPEAK OF YOUR TREASURES AND YOUR DESTINY
cv-valid-test/sample-000520.mp3,I SOLD CRYSTAL AND CROSSED THE DESERT
cv-valid-test/sample-000521.mp3,LOOKING DOWN AT THE SPOON HE HELD THE BOY SAW THAT THE OIL WAS GONE
cv-valid-test/sample-000522.mp3,SO YOU GOT MARRIED
cv-valid-test/sample-000523.mp3,I STILL HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO TURN MYSELF INTO THE WIND THE BOY REPEATED
cv-valid-test/sample-000524.mp3,IN ANY CASE IT'S GOOD THAT YOU'VE LEARNED THAT EVERYTHING IN LIFE HAS ITS PRIDES
cv-valid-test/sample-000525.mp3,MAYBE BECAUSE THAT WASN'T REALLY HIS DREAM
cv-valid-test/sample-000526.mp3,YOU SHOULD SEE THE OTHER GUY SPECIFICALLY HOW GOOD AT FIGHTING HE IS
cv-valid-test/sample-000527.mp3,THE CAMEL DRIVER WAS SEATED AT THE BASE OF THE ALL TREE OBSERVING HIS SANSER
cv-valid-test/sample-000528.mp3,HE INSTEAD OFFERS AN ALTERNATE EXPLANATION THAT RELATES TO CITES SCALABILITY ASSUES
cv-valid-test/sample-000529.mp3,I FOUND A LITTLE CROWD OF ABOUT TWENTY REBILDS SURROUNDING THE HAYUGE HALL
cv-valid-test/sample-000530.mp3,MY WIFE POINTED OUT TO ME THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE RED GREEN AND YELLOW SIGNAL LIGHTS
cv-valid-test/sample-000531.mp3,SHE PLACED THE GLASS CAREFULLY ON THE EDGE OF THE TABLE
cv-valid-test/sample-000532.mp3,BECAUSE YOU WILL NEVER AGAIN BE ABLE TO KEEP IT QUIET
cv-valid-test/sample-000533.mp3,I CAN SEND CONTEXTUAL INFORMATION TO IT FROM OTHER ABBS
cv-valid-test/sample-000534.mp3,EVERYONE SEEMED VERY EXCITED
cv-valid-test/sample-000535.mp3,WHY WAS IT THAT HE WANTED THE BOY TO SERVE AS AN INSTRUMENT
cv-valid-test/sample-000536.mp3,SHE WASN'T HER TYPE
cv-valid-test/sample-000537.mp3,I'LL HAVE IT IN A MINUTE
cv-valid-test/sample-000538.mp3,THEY WERE LOOKING ONLY FOR GOLD HIS COMPANION ANSWERED
cv-valid-test/sample-000539.mp3,YOU CAN HEAR OF TE FECT
cv-valid-test/sample-000540.mp3,BUT SHE SAID NOTHING
cv-valid-test/sample-000541.mp3,I THINK I FIND SOMETHING
cv-valid-test/sample-000542.mp3,AND THEN THERE WERE THE OTHERS WHO WERE INTERESTED ONLY IN GOLD
cv-valid-test/sample-000543.mp3,MAY I GO IN AND SEE HIM
cv-valid-test/sample-000544.mp3,IT DIDN'T EVEN OCCUR TO THE BOY TO FLEE
cv-valid-test/sample-000545.mp3,WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT
cv-valid-test/sample-000546.mp3,MAYBE THAT'S WHY THEY CAME
cv-valid-test/sample-000547.mp3,I KNOW THAT GIRL
cv-valid-test/sample-000548.mp3,I'D LIKE TO BUILD A DISPLAYCASE FOR THE CRYSTAL THE BOY SAID TO THE MERCHANT
cv-valid-test/sample-000549.mp3,IT'S A PRIVATE CLUB FOR ONLY THE MOST RESPECTABLE PEOPLE
cv-valid-test/sample-000550.mp3,WE MAUGRATED OUR STUFF FROM MACCAUIS TO LAUNUM
cv-valid-test/sample-000551.mp3,TOO MUCH FOOD IS BEING WASTED
cv-valid-test/sample-000552.mp3,OTHER SERVANTS MAINTAINED THE FIRES IN THEIR HOOKAS
cv-valid-test/sample-000553.mp3,YOU GOT SOME PLACE TO SLEEP
cv-valid-test/sample-000554.mp3,THEIR FACES WERE HIDDEN BEHIND BLUE VEILS WITH ONLY THEIR EYES SHOWING
cv-valid-test/sample-000555.mp3,BUT THAT WAS SIMPLY BECAUSE MY EYE WAS TIRED
cv-valid-test/sample-000556.mp3,BUT NONE OF THAT IS FROM THE PYRAMIDS SAID THE ALCHEMIST
cv-valid-test/sample-000557.mp3,THAT INSANE ANDRUIT CONTINUES TO IGNORE ME
cv-valid-test/sample-000558.mp3,BUT THEN HE STOPPED
cv-valid-test/sample-000559.mp3,WHAT IS LOVE THE DESERT ASKED
cv-valid-test/sample-000560.mp3,BETTER BRING ME A GLASS OF MEAL
cv-valid-test/sample-000561.mp3,ARE YOU SURE THIS IS CLEAR
cv-valid-test/sample-000562.mp3,THEY MIGHT HAVE EVEN BECOME FRIENDS BUT THE ENGLISHMAN CLOSED OFF THE CONVERSATION
cv-valid-test/sample-000563.mp3,SOME STORMS ARE WORTH THE WRECKAGE
cv-valid-test/sample-000564.mp3,SHE SPOKE SWEEDISH HE SPOKE SPANISH
cv-valid-test/sample-000565.mp3,I POINTED OUT MARS A BRIGHT DOT OF LIGHT
cv-valid-test/sample-000566.mp3,DO NOT DO TOMORROW WHAT YOU COULD DO TODAY
cv-valid-test/sample-000567.mp3,SO WHAT DO YOU WANT OF ME THE SUN ASKED
cv-valid-test/sample-000568.mp3,NO ONE SEEMED TO HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT IT THAT NIGHT
cv-valid-test/sample-000569.mp3,THE BOY SPENT A SLEEPLESS NIGHT
cv-valid-test/sample-000570.mp3,THE TOP HAD SUDDENLY CEASED TO RETATE
cv-valid-test/sample-000571.mp3,IT'S LIKE THE FLIGHT OF THOSE TWO HAWKS IT CAN'T BE UNDERSTOOD BY REASON ALONE
cv-valid-test/sample-000572.mp3,AND SO DESPITE THE FACT THAT HE WAS A ROMAN CENTURIAN HE CONVERTED TO THEIR FAITH
cv-valid-test/sample-000573.mp3,IS THIS THE EAR YOU CAN'T HEAR ON
cv-valid-test/sample-000574.mp3,DURING ONE OF THESE CONVERSATIONS THE DRIVER TOLD OF HIS OWN LIFE
cv-valid-test/sample-000575.mp3,A LINE OF FLAME HIGH CAN BE SEEN IN THE ATMOSPHERE
cv-valid-test/sample-000576.mp3,THE FIRST RULE OF DUNT FIGHT CLUB IS LET STUCK ABOUT IT
cv-valid-test/sample-000577.mp3,YOU'LL LITTLE AND YOULL LEARNED THAT A MAN SHOULDN'T BE SO STUPID
cv-valid-test/sample-000578.mp3,IT WAS IN MEGA MONSTER MADE OF METAL
cv-valid-test/sample-000579.mp3,WHY HAVE YOU GOT TO REPORT
cv-valid-test/sample-000580.mp3,FROM THE RAILWAY STATION IN THE DISTANCE CAME THE SOUND OF TRAINS RINGING AND RUMBLING
cv-valid-test/sample-000581.mp3,GO AND SPEAK TO THE TRIBAL CHIEFTAINS SAID THE CAMEL DRIVER
cv-valid-test/sample-000582.mp3,A LOT OF PATIENCS BUT SHEPHERDS KNOW ALL ABOUT PATIENCE
cv-valid-test/sample-000583.mp3,IT WAS BETTER THAN THE SAND OF THE HOOKAS
cv-valid-test/sample-000584.mp3,I THINK THEY PERCEIVED THAT NOTHING WAS TO BE DONE AT THE MOMENT
cv-valid-test/sample-000585.mp3,EVEN IF YOU CLEAN MY CRYSTAL FOR AN ENTIRE YEAR
cv-valid-test/sample-000586.mp3,BEFORE GUNS WERE INVENTED ARMIES HAD TO THROW BULLETS AT EACH OTHER AND IF A BULLET TOUCHED YUTYOU HAD TO SIT OUT UNTIL THE NEXT WAR
cv-valid-test/sample-000587.mp3,HE'S DOING IT BECAUSE IT'S WHAT HE WANTS TO DO
cv-valid-test/sample-000588.mp3,AND ONE OR TWO PERSONS WERE RETURNING
cv-valid-test/sample-000589.mp3,THE ONLY SHADOW WAS THAT OF THE FEW SCATTERED PINE TREES
cv-valid-test/sample-000590.mp3,WELL THEN WHY DID YOU LET ME DO IT THE BOY ASKED
cv-valid-test/sample-000591.mp3,MAYBE SHE DIDN'T EVEN REMEMBER HIM
cv-valid-test/sample-000592.mp3,HE DIDN'T WANT ANY CONVERSATION AT THIS POINT
cv-valid-test/sample-000593.mp3,HE HAD TRIED IN VAIN TO ESTABLISH A RELATIONSHIP WITH AN ALCHEMIST
cv-valid-test/sample-000594.mp3,FIRST THEY TRIED TO FIND HIM ON THEIR HOME
cv-valid-test/sample-000595.mp3,I LOCKED EYES WITH A FISH IN THE TANK
cv-valid-test/sample-000596.mp3,HOW COULD YOU EVEN THINK THAT
cv-valid-test/sample-000597.mp3,JACKSON WAS GLAD THAT HE'D WORE KEVELAR THAT MORNING
cv-valid-test/sample-000598.mp3,THE ALCHEMIST RAISED THE CIRCLE IN THE SAND AND THE SNAKE SLITHERED AWAY AMONG THE ROCKS
cv-valid-test/sample-000599.mp3,THEY HAD GONE AWAY TO BREAKFAST AT HENDERSON'S HOUSE
cv-valid-test/sample-000600.mp3,THE BOY WAS STARTLED
cv-valid-test/sample-000601.mp3,THE CAMEL DRIVER THOUGH SEEMED NOT TO BE VERY CONCERMED WITH THE THREAT OF WAR
cv-valid-test/sample-000602.mp3,MAYBE THAT'S WHY THEY GIVE UP ARNIT SO EARLY TOO
cv-valid-test/sample-000603.mp3,THE END OF THE CYLINDER WAS STILL AS OGILVY AND HENDERSON HAD LEFT IT
cv-valid-test/sample-000604.mp3,HE TOOK OUT HIS MONEY AND COUNTED IT
cv-valid-test/sample-000605.mp3,THIS IS UNFAIR
cv-valid-test/sample-000606.mp3,THE RELIEF ON HER FACE SHOWED THAT SHE UNDERSTOOD
cv-valid-test/sample-000607.mp3,I HAD THE EVERYONE HAS GARRYBOOTHSE'S TEETH DREAM AGAIN
cv-valid-test/sample-000608.mp3,HE HAD TRIED IN VAIN TO ESTABLISH A RELATIONSHIP WITH AN ALCHEMIST
cv-valid-test/sample-000609.mp3,BUT I'D LIKE TO SEE THE CASTLES IN THE TOWNS WHERE THEY LIVE THE BOY EXPLAINED
cv-valid-test/sample-000610.mp3,I KNOWS I'M A VERKSURYN
cv-valid-test/sample-000611.mp3,MOST METEORITES ARE MORE OR LESS ROUNDED
cv-valid-test/sample-000612.mp3,MAYBE SHE DIDN'T EVEN REMEMBER HIM
cv-valid-test/sample-000613.mp3,ONCE TO THE FAITH AT ONCE TO THE GENERAL
cv-valid-test/sample-000614.mp3,I WANT TO SEE HIM DO IT SAID THE CHIEF
cv-valid-test/sample-000615.mp3,AND THEN HE PERCEIVED IT VERY SLOWLY
cv-valid-test/sample-000616.mp3,SO HOW WILL WE NAME ALL THESE HURRICANES
cv-valid-test/sample-000617.mp3,BUT THE BOY WAS TOO FRIGHTENED TO LISTEN TO WORDS OF WISDOM
cv-valid-test/sample-000618.mp3,AMY'S INGENIOUS AT RESEARCH
cv-valid-test/sample-000619.mp3,THE FIRST RULE OF DON'T FIGHT CLUB IS LET'S TALK ABOUT IT
cv-valid-test/sample-000620.mp3,BUT HE DECIDED TO TAKE A CHANCE
cv-valid-test/sample-000621.mp3,THEY ALWAYS DO THAT
cv-valid-test/sample-000622.mp3,IN SPITE OF THIS I STILL BELIEVED THAT THERE WERE MEN IN MARS
cv-valid-test/sample-000623.mp3,THEY PLACED THE SYMBOLS OF THE PILGRIMAGE ON THE DOORS OF THEIR HOUSES
cv-valid-test/sample-000624.mp3,THE DRIVERS CURRIED THE FREIGHT THEMSELVES OVER SUCH STRETCHES FOOTING AND THEN RELOADED THE CAMELS
cv-valid-test/sample-000625.mp3,NO IMESS DON'T WHAT I MEAN
cv-valid-test/sample-000626.mp3,MAYBE IT WAS BECAUSE THEY MOVED AROUND SO MUCH
cv-valid-test/sample-000627.mp3,AFTER TWO HOURS HE RETURNED TO THE ROOM WHERE THE WISE MAN WAS
cv-valid-test/sample-000628.mp3,I THINK IT'S ABOUT BIRD HUNTING BUT NOW I CAN SEE HOW THAT MIGHT BE MISINTERPRETED
cv-valid-test/sample-000629.mp3,HE HEARD A MUFFLED GRATIN SOUND AND SAW THE BLACK MARK JERK FORWARD AN INCH OR SO
cv-valid-test/sample-000630.mp3,WHEN TALKING TO SOMEONE WHO HAS JUST STARTED TO LEARN THE LANGUAGE IT'S GOOD TO SPEAK SLOWLY AND CLEARLY
cv-valid-test/sample-000631.mp3,HE BECAME FRIENDLY WITH THE CAMEL DRIVER WHO TRAVELLED ALONGSIDE HIM
cv-valid-test/sample-000632.mp3,THE WIND BEGAN TO PICK UP
cv-valid-test/sample-000633.mp3,EXCELLENT MAN WHO KNOWS ALL THE SECRETS OF THE WORLD SHE SAID
cv-valid-test/sample-000634.mp3,THEN CAME THE NIGHT OF THE FIRST FOLLY STAR
cv-valid-test/sample-000635.mp3,BEFORE THE BOY COULD REPLY A BUTTERFLY APPEARED AND FLUTTERED BETWEEN HIM AND THE OLD MAN
cv-valid-test/sample-000636.mp3,IS THAT A SCRUBLE PIATPAT STILL AROUND
cv-valid-test/sample-000637.mp3,LOVE REQUIRED THEM TO STAY WITH THE PEOPLE THEY LOVED
cv-valid-test/sample-000638.mp3,HE'S IN THE INSURANCE BUSINESS
cv-valid-test/sample-000639.mp3,THE WALS WERE PETITIOUS BUT SOOTHING
cv-valid-test/sample-000640.mp3,NO ONE SEEMED TO HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT IT THAT NIGHT
cv-valid-test/sample-000641.mp3,I THOUGHT ABOUT THE DIFFICULTIES IN TRANSLATION THAT MIGHT ARISE
cv-valid-test/sample-000642.mp3,I FOUND A LITTLE CROWD OF ABOUT TWENTY PEOPLE SURROUNDING THE HUGE HOLE
cv-valid-test/sample-000643.mp3,SO NOW I FEAR NOTHING BECAUSE IT WAS THOSE OMENS THAT BROUGHT YOU TO ME
cv-valid-test/sample-000644.mp3,I'M THE LEADER OF THE CARAMA SAID A DARG EYED BEARDED MAN
cv-valid-test/sample-000645.mp3,AND HE DESIDED WHO GOLTSES AND ED SHEEPS LOFE A CHILD
cv-valid-test/sample-000646.mp3,HE HAD ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT THE SHEEP WERE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HE SAID
cv-valid-test/sample-000647.mp3,TWO MORE MONTHS PASSED AND THE SHELF BROUGHT MANY CUSTOMERS INTO THE CRYSTAL SHOP
cv-valid-test/sample-000648.mp3,I DON'T WANT ANY PLASTICS
cv-valid-test/sample-000649.mp3,THIS PUTS ME IN A PECULIAR HOLE
cv-valid-test/sample-000650.mp3,I'M GOING TO TELL YOUR MOTHER ON YOU
cv-valid-test/sample-000651.mp3,IT WAS HOWEVER STILL SO HOT FROM ITS FLIGHT THROUGH THE AIR
cv-valid-test/sample-000652.mp3,I DON'T WANT ANYTHING ELSE IN LIFE
cv-valid-test/sample-000653.mp3,HE SHOULD HAVE DECIDED TO BECOME A SHEPHERD THE BOY SAID
cv-valid-test/sample-000654.mp3,THE BOY BEGAN AGAIN TO READ HIS BOOK BUT HE WAS NO LONGER ABLE TO CONCENTRATE
cv-valid-test/sample-000655.mp3,AFTER ALL WHAT HE HAD ALWAYS WANTED WAS JUST THAT TO KNOW NEW PLACES
cv-valid-test/sample-000656.mp3,TAKE ARAPOLES OFF PATE
cv-valid-test/sample-000657.mp3,HE FELT UNEASY AT THE MAN'S PRESENCE
cv-valid-test/sample-000658.mp3,YOU'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING
cv-valid-test/sample-000659.mp3,BUT HE APPEARED TO BE UNAWARE OF ANY DANGER
cv-valid-test/sample-000660.mp3,THEY BEGAN TO RIDE OUT OVER THE SANDS WITH THE MOON LIGHTING THEIR WAY
cv-valid-test/sample-000661.mp3,NEXT MORNING THERE WERE TWO THOUSAND ARMED MEN SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THE PALM TREES AT ALLFAL
cv-valid-test/sample-000662.mp3,DON'T YOU KNOW THAT GIRL'S VERY SICK
cv-valid-test/sample-000663.mp3,AND AT THAT I TOLD HIM AND HE TOOK MY PLACE
cv-valid-test/sample-000664.mp3,SPAIN IS PRODUCING LOTS OF LETTUSE PEPPERICA AND TOMATOES
cv-valid-test/sample-000665.mp3,HIS HANDS BEGIN TO TREMBLE AND THE WOMAN SENSED IT
cv-valid-test/sample-000666.mp3,YOU PUT SOMETHING WRONG IN THOSE CAPTALS
cv-valid-test/sample-000667.mp3,HE REACHED OVER AND PICKED UP A SHELF FROM THE GRA
cv-valid-test/sample-000668.mp3,HE KNEW HE WAS STRONGER THAN HIS FRIEND
cv-valid-test/sample-000669.mp3,IT MAY BE THE GASES OF THE FIRING THAT CAUSED THE MARTIANS INCONVENIENCE
cv-valid-test/sample-000670.mp3,IT'S THE ONLY ONE THEY HAD LEFT
cv-valid-test/sample-000671.mp3,THEY REACHED THE CENTER OF THE LARGE PLAZA WHERE THE MARKET WAS HELD
cv-valid-test/sample-000672.mp3,HOW DO PEOPLE CELEBRATE GOOD WEATHER OVER THERE
cv-valid-test/sample-000673.mp3,THERE WAS A THUD LIKE FALL OF A GREAT MASS
cv-valid-test/sample-000674.mp3,AND THE SAND AND GRAVEL HAD BEEN FLUNG VIOLENTLY IN EVERY DIRECTION
cv-valid-test/sample-000675.mp3,DON'T SAY ANYTHING FACTIMA INTERRUPTED
cv-valid-test/sample-000676.mp3,THE ANIMALS WERE EXHAUSTED AND THE MEN TALKED AMONG THEMSELVES LESS AND LESS
cv-valid-test/sample-000677.mp3,THE BOY WAITED AND THEN INTERRUPTED THE OLD MAN JUST AS HE HIMSELF HAD BEEN INTERRUPTED
cv-valid-test/sample-000678.mp3,EXCEPT FOR MY ALSERS
cv-valid-test/sample-000679.mp3,HUNDREDS OF OBSERVERS SAW THE FLAME THAT NIGHT IND THE NIGHT AFTER
cv-valid-test/sample-000680.mp3,WHEN YOU ARE IN LOVE THINGS MAKE EVEN MORE SENSE HE THOUGHT
cv-valid-test/sample-000681.mp3,TAKING THE JACKET OUT HE BEGAN TO CLEAN THE GLASSES
cv-valid-test/sample-000682.mp3,AND AND THEN HE WOULD ASK US TO GO BACK TO OUR EASELS AND REPLICATE ALL THE TECHNIQUES IN ONE GO
cv-valid-test/sample-000683.mp3,BUT THE ENGLISHMAN APPEARED NOT TO ATTACH ANY IMPORTANCE TO IT
cv-valid-test/sample-000684.mp3,I THOUGHT THE UNSCREWING MIGHT BE AUTOMATIC
cv-valid-test/sample-000685.mp3,THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE PRINTING PRESS IN THOSE DAYS THE BOY ARGUED
cv-valid-test/sample-000686.mp3,HE WON'T LEAVE THE CIRCLE
cv-valid-test/sample-000687.mp3,IT LOOKED LIKE A RUSTY GAS FLOAT
cv-valid-test/sample-000688.mp3,BUT EVERYONE AND HIS AUNT LILIANS WEEN THROUGH THAT BAG
cv-valid-test/sample-000689.mp3,I'VE GOT IT ALLREADY
cv-valid-test/sample-000690.mp3,ALL THINGS ARE ONE THE OLD MAN HAD SAID
cv-valid-test/sample-000691.mp3,THE BOY TURNED TO THE HAND THAT WROTE ALL
cv-valid-test/sample-000692.mp3,I LOOKED AT THE CYLINDER AGAIN AND WAS COMPLETELY TERRIFIED
cv-valid-test/sample-000693.mp3,COMING HOME A PARIA OF TOURIES PASSED US SINGING AND PLAYING MUSIC
cv-valid-test/sample-000694.mp3,THOSE GYPSIES ARE REALLY SMART HE THOUGHT
cv-valid-test/sample-000695.mp3,IT ISN'T THE MONEY
cv-valid-test/sample-000696.mp3,IF HE ABANDONS THAT PURSUIT IT'S BECAUSE IT WASN'T TRUE LOVE
cv-valid-test/sample-000697.mp3,MY SEVEN YEAR RESUMI GAP IS MARKED NOT DRUGS
cv-valid-test/sample-000698.mp3,HE COULD SELL THE STONES AND BUY RETURNED TICKAPID
cv-valid-test/sample-000699.mp3,NOT EVEN THE TRIBAL CHIEFTAINS ARE ABLE TO SEE HIM WHEN THEY WANT TO
cv-valid-test/sample-000700.mp3,NOW WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO
cv-valid-test/sample-000701.mp3,THAT'S TRUE THE BOY THOUGHT
cv-valid-test/sample-000702.mp3,HE THOUGHT OF THE MERCHANT'S DAUGHTER AND WAS SURE THAT SHE HAD PROBABLY MARRIED
cv-valid-test/sample-000703.mp3,THE GUY THOUGHT HE WAS A LUNATIC AT LARGE AND MADE AN UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPT TO STOP HIM
cv-valid-test/sample-000704.mp3,NOW LEAVE US ALONE SAID THE BOY TO THE YOUNG ARAB
cv-valid-test/sample-000705.mp3,TODAY I UNDERSTAND SOMETHING I DIDN'T SEE BEFORE EVERY BLESSING IGNORED BECOMES A CURSE
cv-valid-test/sample-000706.mp3,BUT ONLY SPEAK A WORD AND MY SERVANT WILL BE HEALED
cv-valid-test/sample-000707.mp3,THEN WHOSE IS IT
cv-valid-test/sample-000708.mp3,TWO HORSEMEN WAITING AHEAD OF THEM
cv-valid-test/sample-000709.mp3,BUT YOU KNOW THAT I'M NOT GOING TO GO TO MECCA
cv-valid-test/sample-000710.mp3,WHO WROTE THAT SPEECH FOR YOU
cv-valid-test/sample-000711.mp3,THE ARTICLE SHOULD DISCUSS POSSIBLE APPROACHES TO IMAGE REGISTRATION
cv-valid-test/sample-000712.mp3,MAYBE WE'RE ALL THAT WAY THE BOY MUSED
cv-valid-test/sample-000713.mp3,BUT THEY WERE NOT THERE
cv-valid-test/sample-000714.mp3,NOW I TOO WILL BE ONE OF THE WOMEN WHO ATE
cv-valid-test/sample-000715.mp3,IT'S EASY AND YET I'VE NEVER DONE IT BEFORE HE THOUGHT
cv-valid-test/sample-000716.mp3,ILL THINK MAYBE YOU'D BETTER
cv-valid-test/sample-000717.mp3,SEE IF WE CAN MOVE IT
cv-valid-test/sample-000718.mp3,NOW HIS INTUITION WAS THAT HE HAD BEEN RIGHT IN COMING
cv-valid-test/sample-000719.mp3,HAVING HEARD THAT THE BOY BECAME EVEN MORE INTERESTED IN ALCHEMY
cv-valid-test/sample-000720.mp3,IT'S JUST THAT I NEVER HAVE
cv-valid-test/sample-000721.mp3,COMING HOME A PART OF TWO RESPECTS USS TO SEE A PLAYING MUSIC
cv-valid-test/sample-000722.mp3,AND THEN HE PERCEIVED IT VERY SLOWLY
cv-valid-test/sample-000723.mp3,YOU OLD SORCERER THE BOY SHOUTED UP TO THE SKY
cv-valid-test/sample-000724.mp3,ALL I SAW WAS AN ARMY SAID THE BOY
cv-valid-test/sample-000725.mp3,THE BOY FELL TO THE SAND NEARLY UNCONSCIOUS
cv-valid-test/sample-000726.mp3,ALL THINGS ARE WHEN THE BOY HOPED
cv-valid-test/sample-000727.mp3,ALMOST EVERYONE HERE SPEAKS SPANISH
cv-valid-test/sample-000728.mp3,THE THING ITSELF WAS ALMOST ENTIRELY BURIED IN SAND
cv-valid-test/sample-000729.mp3,IT WAS A KIND OF FASCINATION THAT PARALYSED MY ACTIONS
cv-valid-test/sample-000730.mp3,THEY'RE ALWAYS AFTER ME FOR INTERVIEWS
cv-valid-test/sample-000731.mp3,WHAT GOOD IS MONEY TO YOU IF YOU'RE GOING TO DIE
cv-valid-test/sample-000732.mp3,EVENCING SLOWLY THEY SEARCHED AMONG THE STONES
cv-valid-test/sample-000733.mp3,AN ALCHEMIST SAID THE ALCHEMIST
cv-valid-test/sample-000734.mp3,WAS THE DOCTOR HERE
cv-valid-test/sample-000735.mp3,PUT JACKY RIGHT ON THE STAFF
cv-valid-test/sample-000736.mp3,SHE WANTS TO SEND YOU ON A LECTURE TO HER
cv-valid-test/sample-000737.mp3,BUT AS HE SAW THEM LYING THERE ON THE GROUND ANOTHER PHRASE CAME TO HIS MIND
cv-valid-test/sample-000738.mp3,BECAUSE YOU HAVE ALREADY LOST YOUR SAVINGS TWICE
cv-valid-test/sample-000739.mp3,THE DEAD SOLDIERS WERE REPLACED BY OTHERS AND LIFE WENT ON
cv-valid-test/sample-000740.mp3,I DIDN'T KNOW THE SHEPHERDS KNEW HOW TO READ SAID A GIRL'S VOICE BEHIND HIM
cv-valid-test/sample-000741.mp3,I LEARNED HOW TO CARE FOR SHEEP AND I HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN HOW THAT'S DONE
cv-valid-test/sample-000742.mp3,I WAS IMPATIENT TO SEE IT OPENED
cv-valid-test/sample-000743.mp3,TO NOURISH THE PALCOM
cv-valid-test/sample-000744.mp3,A LITTLE GROUP OF PEOPLE FROM THE CITY DISPERSED
cv-valid-test/sample-000745.mp3,WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
cv-valid-test/sample-000746.mp3,THE CARAVANS HAD BEEN STOPPED AT GIZA FOR SOME TIME WAITING FOR THE WARS TO END
cv-valid-test/sample-000747.mp3,LEARN TO RECOGNIZE OMENS AND FOLLOW THEM THE OLD KING HAD SAID
cv-valid-test/sample-000748.mp3,I WOULD HAVE WON THE JUNIOR OLYMPICS IF NOT FOR THOSE MEDDLING CIADS
cv-valid-test/sample-000749.mp3,BUT HE CERTAINLY DIDN'T DESIRE IT THAT AS ANALMY ENVAY THE OASIS
cv-valid-test/sample-000750.mp3,THE FIRST DAY EVERYONE SLEPT FROM EXHAUSTION INCLUDING THE ENGLISHMAN
cv-valid-test/sample-000751.mp3,MAYBE NOBONE KNOWS WHAT AN ALCHEMIST IS
cv-valid-test/sample-000752.mp3,THEY WORKED FROM EARLY MORNING TILL LATE EVENING
cv-valid-test/sample-000753.mp3,BUT THE BOY NEVER TOOK HIS EYE OFF HIS NEW FRIEND
cv-valid-test/sample-000754.mp3,THEY HAD GONE AWAY TO BREAKFAST AT HENDERSON'S HOUSE
cv-valid-test/sample-000755.mp3,THE ALCHEMIST TURNED TO THE BOY
cv-valid-test/sample-000756.mp3,THEN THE TWO WENT OFF TO HAVE SOME MORE TEA
cv-valid-test/sample-000757.mp3,THE ALCHEMIST PROBABLY ALREADY KNEW ALL THAT
cv-valid-test/sample-000758.mp3,THAT'S AN IDHERENT DISADVANTAGE
cv-valid-test/sample-000759.mp3,I CAN ONLY TELL YOU WHAT I SAW
cv-valid-test/sample-000760.mp3,HE REALLY WAS A KING A WISE KING
cv-valid-test/sample-000761.mp3,YOU WERE SEEN AT THE ENEMY CAMP THREE DAYS AGO
cv-valid-test/sample-000762.mp3,IN ALCHEMY IT'S CALLED THE STOLE OF THE WORLD
cv-valid-test/sample-000763.mp3,I WRITE ONLY ONE THAT THE BURDS WANTED TO TELL
cv-valid-test/sample-000764.mp3,A PRACTICE OF INFIDELS HE SAID TO HIMSELF
cv-valid-test/sample-000765.mp3,HE WAS OLDER AND WAS CARRYING A SMALL BUCKARD
cv-valid-test/sample-000766.mp3,THE BOY TOOK OUT ERIM AND THERMIN FROM HIS BAG
cv-valid-test/sample-000767.mp3,THE FINE MARK OF TERAIN HAPENY WAS A BOOK PEOPLE FOR FOURTEEN YEARS
cv-valid-test/sample-000768.mp3,THAT'S A LOT OF HOOING
cv-valid-test/sample-000769.mp3,THE CROWD SWAYED A LITTLE AS I ELBOWED MY WAY THROUGH
cv-valid-test/sample-000770.mp3,REPLACE THE PEAS IN TINTEBO'S NAME WITH ANY OTHER CONSONANT TO GET A SAWWOOL'S CHARACTER
cv-valid-test/sample-000771.mp3,BUT THIS DEPAYMENT GOES WEALER BEYOND MY GENEROSITY THE MONK RESPONDED
cv-valid-test/sample-000772.mp3,YOU CAN'T DO THAT
cv-valid-test/sample-000773.mp3,WE NEED TO BE CONFIDENT ALL OF US HE PROPOSED AS EMOTION
cv-valid-test/sample-000774.mp3,MAKE YOUR HEREO SURE AS YOU'RE BORN
cv-valid-test/sample-000775.mp3,MOST METEORITES ARE MORE OR LESS ROUMDLED
cv-valid-test/sample-000776.mp3,FINALLY A YOUNG WOMAN APPROACHED WHO WAS NOT DRESSED IN BLACK
cv-valid-test/sample-000777.mp3,THE AREA WAS SWIRLING IN DUST SO INTENSE THAT IT HID THE MOON FROM VIEW
cv-valid-test/sample-000778.mp3,THE ENGLISHMAN WAS DISAPPOINTED
cv-valid-test/sample-000779.mp3,REVENGE IS NOT MY STYLE BUT OBVIOUSLY ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN
cv-valid-test/sample-000780.mp3,HE CARRIED TWO DEAD HAWKS OVER HIS SHOULDER
cv-valid-test/sample-000781.mp3,AIR WAS EITHER ENTERING OR ESCAPING AT THE RIM WITH A THIN SIZZLING SOUND
cv-valid-test/sample-000782.mp3,THE MAN WAS SPEAKING THE LANGUAGE OF ALCHEMY
cv-valid-test/sample-000783.mp3,THEN WHY SHOULD THEY BE SURPRISED WHEN THEY SEE ONE
cv-valid-test/sample-000784.mp3,THE RANGER TOOK HIS RIFLE AND WENT INTO THE FOREST TO SHOOT THE BEAR
cv-valid-test/sample-000785.mp3,WHY WAS IT THAT HE WANTED THE BOY TO SALEVATE HIS INSTRUMENT
cv-valid-test/sample-000786.mp3,THE ALCHEMIST OPENED A BOTTLE AND POURED A RED LIQUID INTO THE BOY'S CUP
cv-valid-test/sample-000787.mp3,NEITHER THE RAYDAR NOR THE OTHER INSTRUMENTS DETECTED THE STEALTH BOMME
cv-valid-test/sample-000788.mp3,IT REMINDED HIM OF THE WOOD FROM HIS SHEEP
cv-valid-test/sample-000789.mp3,YOU'RE NOT ASKING A FAVOR OF HIM
cv-valid-test/sample-000790.mp3,I CAN CLEAN UP THOSE GLASSES IN THE WINDOW IF YOU WANT SAID THE BOY
cv-valid-test/sample-000791.mp3,MAYBE TOMORROW SAID THE BOY MOVING AWAY
cv-valid-test/sample-000792.mp3,SO WHEN I LOOKED OUT OVER YOUR SANDS I'M ALSO LOOKING AT HERE
cv-valid-test/sample-000793.mp3,AT THAT POINT IN THEIR LIVES EVERYTHING IS CLEAR AND EVERYTHING IS POSSIBLE
cv-valid-test/sample-000794.mp3,HE ROSE AND MADE HIS WAY BACK TOWARD THE PAUND TREENS
cv-valid-test/sample-000795.mp3,I'VE NEVER SEEN A WROTH'S CHILD BEFORE
cv-valid-test/sample-000796.mp3,THAT MAKES SENSE THE ALCHEMIST ANSWERED
cv-valid-test/sample-000797.mp3,THE BOY LOOKED OUT AT THE HORIZON
cv-valid-test/sample-000798.mp3,I DIDN'T FRISK HIM
cv-valid-test/sample-000799.mp3,IT WAS JUST THAT HE COULDN'T GRASP WHAT IT MEANT
cv-valid-test/sample-000800.mp3,SOME OF THE GREY ASH WAS FALLING OFE THE CIRCULAR EDGE
cv-valid-test/sample-000801.mp3,THAT WAS HIS WORK
cv-valid-test/sample-000802.mp3,SHE'S GOING TO LOSE HER MIND WHEN SHE FINDS OUT
cv-valid-test/sample-000803.mp3,SOMETHING OLDER THAN HUMANITY MORE ANCIENT THAN THE DESERT
cv-valid-test/sample-000804.mp3,KEEP ME HERE UNTIL I GET OVER IT
cv-valid-test/sample-000805.mp3,THE BOY'S BE COMING BACK TO PHAN
cv-valid-test/sample-000806.mp3,THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT CONTAINS POLITICIANS
cv-valid-test/sample-000807.mp3,IN HIS HEART HE WANTED TO REMAIN AWAKE BUT HE ALSO WANTED TO SLEEP
cv-valid-test/sample-000808.mp3,THAT NIGHT HE TOLD ALL OF THIS TO THE ALCHEMIST
cv-valid-test/sample-000809.mp3,I'M TALKING ABOUT THE BUILDING AND LONE
cv-valid-test/sample-000810.mp3,GYPSIES ARE EXPERTS AT GETTING PEOPLE TO DO THAT SIGHED THE OLD MAN
cv-valid-test/sample-000811.mp3,THE MERCHANTS WERE ASSEMBLING THEIR STALLS AND THE BOY HELPED A CANDY SELLER DO THIS
cv-valid-test/sample-000812.mp3,MACTUP THOUGHT THE BOY
cv-valid-test/sample-000813.mp3,THE NEXT DAY THE BOY RETURNED TO THE WELL HOPING TO SEE THE GIRD
cv-valid-test/sample-000814.mp3,AND HE DECIDED HE WOULD GO TO SEE THE CHIEFS OF THE TRIBES
cv-valid-test/sample-000815.mp3,BUSINESS HAS REALLY IMPROVED HE SAID TO THE BOY AFTER THE CUSTOMER HAD LEFT
cv-valid-test/sample-000816.mp3,THE SHOP WAS BUSY AND THE MAN ASKED THE SHEPHERD TO WAIT UNTIL THE AFTERNOON
cv-valid-test/sample-000817.mp3,BUT HE KEPT THE SWORD IN HIS HAND
cv-valid-test/sample-000818.mp3,THE WIND TOLD ME THAT YOU KNOW ABOUT LOVE THE BOY SAID TO THE SUN
cv-valid-test/sample-000819.mp3,I HAVE TO SEPARATE OUT THE SULPHUR
cv-valid-test/sample-000820.mp3,I'M WANTING HERN NOW
cv-valid-test/sample-000821.mp3,BUT ONLY SPEAK A WORD AND MY SERVANT WILL BE HEALED
cv-valid-test/sample-000822.mp3,IN HIS HEART HE WANTED TO REMAIN AWAKE BUT HE ALSO WANTED TO SLEEP
cv-valid-test/sample-000823.mp3,HE WAS SHAKEN INTO WAKEFULNESS BY SOMEONE
cv-valid-test/sample-000824.mp3,BUT EVERYTHING HAD CHANGED
cv-valid-test/sample-000825.mp3,THE HAND WITH THE WHIP POINTED TO THE SOUTH
cv-valid-test/sample-000826.mp3,I GOT WAYS OF MAKING THEM TALK
cv-valid-test/sample-000827.mp3,WHEN HE HAD COMPLETED THE CLEANING HE ASKED THE MAN FOR SOMETHING TO EAT
cv-valid-test/sample-000828.mp3,I THINK THEY PERCEIVED THAT NOTHING WAS TO BE DONE AT THE MOMENT
cv-valid-test/sample-000829.mp3,IT WAS AS IF IT QUIVERED BUT REALLY THIS WAS THE TELESCOPE VIBRATING
cv-valid-test/sample-000830.mp3,I WOULDN'T LIVE IN IT AS A GHOST
cv-valid-test/sample-000831.mp3,THE ANIMALS WERE EXHAUSTED AND THE MEN TALKED AMONG THEMSELVES LESS AND LESS
cv-valid-test/sample-000832.mp3,AUGILVI TOLD HIM EVERYTHING THAT HE HAD SEEN
cv-valid-test/sample-000833.mp3,AND ALSO BECAUSE I KNOW ABOUT THE SOUL OF THE WORLD HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF
cv-valid-test/sample-000834.mp3,THE OMENS HAD TOLD HIM SO
cv-valid-test/sample-000835.mp3,THE PING LOVE HEART KEARING GLOWED
cv-valid-test/sample-000836.mp3,WHAT IS A FOREIGNER DOING HERE ASKED ANOTHER OF THE MEN
cv-valid-test/sample-000837.mp3,IT LOOKED LIKE A RUSTY GAS FLOAT
cv-valid-test/sample-000838.mp3,I FORGOT MY HAT
cv-valid-test/sample-000839.mp3,YOU KNEW THE WHOLE STORY
cv-valid-test/sample-000840.mp3,I LIKE CYNDY WANE
cv-valid-test/sample-000841.mp3,IF YOU PAY ATTENTION TO THE PRESENT YOU CAN IMPROVE UPON IT
cv-valid-test/sample-000842.mp3,WORK HAS BEEN ROUGH THIN THE LAST FEW MONTHS BECAUSE OF A MAJOR PROJECT LAUNCH
cv-valid-test/sample-000843.mp3,THE BOY WATCHED THE EXCHANGE WITH FASCINATION
cv-valid-test/sample-000844.mp3,FROM THE RAILWAY STATION IN THE DISTANCE CAME THE SOUND OF TRAINS RINGING AND RUMBLING
cv-valid-test/sample-000845.mp3,HE TOLD HER ABOUT THE MORNING'S MEETING
cv-valid-test/sample-000846.mp3,THOSE ARE THE RULES OF WAR THE LEADER EXPLAINED
cv-valid-test/sample-000847.mp3,BUT HIS HIRT WAS SPEAKING OF OURSHINKS
cv-valid-test/sample-000848.mp3,THE SHOP FOLKS WERE TAKING DOWN THEIR SHUTTERS AND PEOPLE WERE OPENING THEIR BEDROOM WINDOWS
cv-valid-test/sample-000849.mp3,THEY LOCKED THEMSELVES IN THEIR LABORATORIES AND TRIED TO EVOLVE AS GOLD HAD
cv-valid-test/sample-000850.mp3,HE HAD NEVER IMAGINED THAT QUESTIONS ABOUT LIFE WOULD BE OF SUCH IMPORTANCE TOO A SHEPHERD
cv-valid-test/sample-000851.mp3,HE HEARD A MUFFLED GRATING SOUND AND SAW THE BLACK MARK JERK FORWARD AN INCH OR TWO
cv-valid-test/sample-000852.mp3,THEN YOU TAUGHT ME SOMETHING OF THE UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE AND THE SOUL OF THE WORLD
cv-valid-test/sample-000853.mp3,AND YOUR CAMELS WILL BRING YOU WEALTH AND POWER
cv-valid-test/sample-000854.mp3,THE BOY LOOKED AROUND FOR THE OVENS AND OTHER APPARATUS USED AN ALCHEMY BUT SAW NONE
cv-valid-test/sample-000855.mp3,AND SEIZING THE BOY'S BAG THE ALCHEMIST GAVE THE GOLD COINS TO THE CHIEF
cv-valid-test/sample-000856.mp3,EVEN THEN HE HARDLY UNDERSTOOD WHAT THIS MEANT
cv-valid-test/sample-000857.mp3,VIBRATIONS OF PEACE THROUGHOUT THE TENT
cv-valid-test/sample-000858.mp3,I'M HUNTING WITH MY FALCON THE ALCHEMIST ANSWERED
cv-valid-test/sample-000859.mp3,THERE WAS A FULL MOON AND THE BOY TOLD THE ENGLISHMAN THE STORY OF HIS LIFE
cv-valid-test/sample-000860.mp3,THEY WERE STRANGE BOOKS
cv-valid-test/sample-000861.mp3,THE CAMEL DRIVER WAS NOT A FIGHTER AND HE HAD CONSULTED WITH SEERS
cv-valid-test/sample-000862.mp3,HE GOT UP EARLY WITH THE IDEA OF FINDING IT
cv-valid-test/sample-000863.mp3,REPLACE THE TEAS IN TIM TEBO'S NAME WITH ANY OTHER CONSONANT TO GET A STARBOAY'S CHARACTER
cv-valid-test/sample-000864.mp3,I THOUGHT THE ENSCREWING MIGHT BE AUTOMATIC
cv-valid-test/sample-000865.mp3,BUT I WAS ALSO STUMBLING BECAUSE I COULDN'T LOOK AWAY FROM THESE THINGS
cv-valid-test/sample-000866.mp3,THERE'S MILLIONS OF WAYS
cv-valid-test/sample-000867.mp3,WHAT DO I DO IN SALEM THE OLD MAN LAUGHED
cv-valid-test/sample-000868.mp3,HAVING HEARD THAT THE BOY BECAME EVEN MORE INTERESTED IN ALCHEMY
cv-valid-test/sample-000869.mp3,THERE ARE RUMORS OF TRIBAL WARS HE TOLD THEM
cv-valid-test/sample-000870.mp3,EVEN IF YOU'RE AN EXPERT READING ALL OF IT IS OF NOT FEASIBLE DUE TO A LUCK OF TIME
cv-valid-test/sample-000871.mp3,ROBIN HAD SOME SORT OF DATE WITH TRACY
cv-valid-test/sample-000872.mp3,THE WOMAN SAID SHE HAD NEVER HEARD OF SUCH A PERSON AND HURRIED AWAY
cv-valid-test/sample-000873.mp3,MODERN SOWING MACHINES CAN THROP AWAY SPURRY
cv-valid-test/sample-000874.mp3,MARY TOLD ME THAT SHE GOT TO MEET UP WITH YOU WHILE SHE WAS BACK IN SAN FRANCISCO
cv-valid-test/sample-000875.mp3,YOU CAN'T SAY THAT ABOUT MY FATHER
cv-valid-test/sample-000876.mp3,THE STREAMER OF GAS CAME OUT TOWARDS US
cv-valid-test/sample-000877.mp3,THE USAGE OF HIGH INFORMATION CONTENT IS MEANINGLESS
cv-valid-test/sample-000878.mp3,THE BOY CONTINUED TO LISTEN TO HIS HEART AS THEY CROSSED THE DESERT
cv-valid-test/sample-000879.mp3,BUT THE CRYSTAL MERCHANT HAD NO CHOICE
cv-valid-test/sample-000880.mp3,INSTEAD THE STRANGER LOWERED IT SLOWLY UNTIL THE POINT TOUCHED THE BOY'S FOREHEAD
cv-valid-test/sample-000881.mp3,WE DON'T KNOW SCOTT
cv-valid-test/sample-000882.mp3,BUT MAYBE I'LL NEVER HAVE ANOTHER CHANCE TO GET TO THE PYRAMIDS IN EGYPT
cv-valid-test/sample-000883.mp3,ALWAYS HEED THE OMENS THE OLD KING HAD SAID
cv-valid-test/sample-000884.mp3,AND THIS IS FOR ME SAID THE ALCHEMIST KEEPING ONE OF THE PARTS
cv-valid-test/sample-000885.mp3,SO WHAT IS SALEM LIKE HE ASKED TRYING TO GET SOME SORT OF CLUE
cv-valid-test/sample-000886.mp3,LIKE CRICKETS AND LIKE EXPECTATIONS LIKE LIZARDS AND FOUR LEAF CLOVERS
cv-valid-test/sample-000887.mp3,HE HAD BEEN SO FAR AWAY THAT HIS FACE WASN'T EVEN VISIBLE
cv-valid-test/sample-000888.mp3,THAT'S NOT MY MONEY
cv-valid-test/sample-000889.mp3,IS HE REALLY SUPPOSED TO READ THAT MANY BOOKS ON PHILOSOPHY
cv-valid-test/sample-000890.mp3,I GET THIRTY DOLLARS A WEEK
cv-valid-test/sample-000891.mp3,THE ENGLISHMAN VANISHED TOO GONE TO FIND THE ALCHEMIST
cv-valid-test/sample-000892.mp3,AND IT KNEW NOTHING ABOUT LOVE
cv-valid-test/sample-000893.mp3,OH IT'S NOT SUCH A BIG DEAL RIGHT AWAY
cv-valid-test/sample-000894.mp3,AND THEN HE PERCEIVED IT VERY SLOWLY
cv-valid-test/sample-000895.mp3,THE BOY CLOSED HIS BOOK
cv-valid-test/sample-000896.mp3,HOWEVER THE ARTICLE IS WRITTEN POORLY AND INCOMPREHENSIBLY
cv-valid-test/sample-000897.mp3,THE MICROPHONE PUT OUT A MUFFLED SIGNAL
cv-valid-test/sample-000898.mp3,IT WAS THE LEVENDER THE WIND THAT CAME FROM AFRICA
cv-valid-test/sample-000899.mp3,I'M AFRAID YOU'RE BLOCKING MY VIEW
cv-valid-test/sample-000900.mp3,AS THEY MOVED ALONG THE BOY TRIED TO LISTEN TO HIS HEART
cv-valid-test/sample-000901.mp3,MAYBE WE'RE ALL THAT WAY THE BOY MOST
cv-valid-test/sample-000902.mp3,THEY WALKED IN FROM THE RAIN ALL DISHEVELLED AND STEAMING
cv-valid-test/sample-000903.mp3,HE COULD ALWAYS BECOME A CRYSTAL SALISMAN AGAIN
cv-valid-test/sample-000904.mp3,THE OLD MAN WORE A BREASTPLATE OF HEAVY GOLD COVERED WITH PRECIOUS STONES
cv-valid-test/sample-000905.mp3,I SOLD CRYSTAL AND CROSSED THE DESERT
cv-valid-test/sample-000906.mp3,A LADDER OF THE FIREJUCT WAS NOT LONG ENOUPH
cv-valid-test/sample-000907.mp3,IS SHE COMING BACK HERE
cv-valid-test/sample-000908.mp3,THEY CALLED IT THE SIMUM AND IT WAS WORSE THAN A STORM AT SEA
cv-valid-test/sample-000909.mp3,THE FIRST RULE OF DON'T FIGHT CLUB IS LET'S TALK ABOUT IT
cv-valid-test/sample-000910.mp3,WHEN YOU'RE LOVED YOU CAN DO ANYTHING IN CREATION
cv-valid-test/sample-000911.mp3,I UNLESTAND SHEEP THEY'RE NO LONGER A PROBLEM AND THEY CAN BE GOOD FRIENDS
cv-valid-test/sample-000912.mp3,WE'RE ALL EXCITED AROUND
cv-valid-test/sample-000913.mp3,THERE'S ONE THAT SAYS EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS ONCE CAN NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN
cv-valid-test/sample-000914.mp3,IT'S EXTREMELY SUSPICIOUS THAT THERE'S NO INFORMATION ABOUT BRAINS THAT DIDN'T COME FROM A BRAIN
cv-valid-test/sample-000915.mp3,THE ALCHEMIST IS TWO HUNDRED YEARS OLD THE ENGLISHMAN HAD TOLD HIM
cv-valid-test/sample-000916.mp3,HE DID FIND IT SOON AFTER DAWN AND NOT FAR FROM THE SAND PITS
cv-valid-test/sample-000917.mp3,THEN THE TWO WENT OFF TO HAVE SOME MARTEY
cv-valid-test/sample-000918.mp3,I'LL KEEP YOU IN MIND
cv-valid-test/sample-000919.mp3,ON THE THURDAY THE CHIEF MET WITH HIS OFFICERS
cv-valid-test/sample-000920.mp3,SO WHAT DO YOU WANT OF ME THE SUN ASKED
cv-valid-test/sample-000921.mp3,IT'S EASIER TO ENDURE THE COLD IF YOU HAVE A WARM DRINK IN THE BELLY
cv-valid-test/sample-000922.mp3,DON'T HURT MY SORE ARM AGAIN
cv-valid-test/sample-000923.mp3,IT WAS STARLIGHT AND I EXPLAINED THE SIGNS OF THE SAUDIAC TO HER
cv-valid-test/sample-000924.mp3,THERE WERE MOUNTAINS IN THE DISTANCE
cv-valid-test/sample-000925.mp3,THOMAS WENT TO WAR
cv-valid-test/sample-000926.mp3,IT'S A PRIVATE CLUB FOR ONLY THE MOST RESPECTABLE PEOPLE
cv-valid-test/sample-000927.mp3,THAT SOBERED HIM A LITTLE
cv-valid-test/sample-000928.mp3,IF WE SERVE TEA IN CRYSTAL THE SHOP IS GOING TO EXPAND
cv-valid-test/sample-000929.mp3,ALWAYS ASKE AN OBJECTIVE QUESTION
cv-valid-test/sample-000930.mp3,WHY DO THEY NEED JIN
cv-valid-test/sample-000931.mp3,ALL I SAW WAS AN ARMY SAID THE BOY
cv-valid-test/sample-000932.mp3,WHAT DO YOU WANT HERE TODAY THE DESERT ASKED HIM
cv-valid-test/sample-000933.mp3,MELISSA'S PHONE KEPT VIBRATING UNCONTROLLABLY
cv-valid-test/sample-000934.mp3,AS HINBROWS WERE STORED TOGETHER
cv-valid-test/sample-000935.mp3,THE WAR CONTINUED AND AT TIMES THE WIND CARRIED THE SWEET SICKLY SMELL OF BLOOD
cv-valid-test/sample-000936.mp3,LOOKING THROUGH THE TELESCOPE I SAW A CIRCLE OF DEEP BLUE AND THA LITTLE ROUND PLANET
cv-valid-test/sample-000937.mp3,DURING ONE OF HIS CONVERSATIONS THE DRIVER TOLD OF HIS OWN LIFE
cv-valid-test/sample-000938.mp3,GIVEME THE RECEIVING ROOM
cv-valid-test/sample-000939.mp3,PREFETCHING IS USED TO AVOID CASHMESIS
cv-valid-test/sample-000940.mp3,THEN HE DROPPED HIS SPADE PICKED UPD HIS JACKET AND CAME OUT INTO THE ROAD
cv-valid-test/sample-000941.mp3,THE NEWSPAPER ARTICLES HAD PREPARED EVERYONE FOR THE RECEPTION OF THE IDEA
cv-valid-test/sample-000942.mp3,RAISONS ARE DELICIOUS
cv-valid-test/sample-000943.mp3,HE'S OW DUCK SHOOTING NOW
cv-valid-test/sample-000944.mp3,THEN SHE FILLED HER VESSEL WITH WATER AND LEFT
cv-valid-test/sample-000945.mp3,NATURALLY WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT
cv-valid-test/sample-000946.mp3,THERE WERE RAISED VOICES AND SOME SORT OF STRUGGLE APPEARED TO BE GOING ON
cv-valid-test/sample-000947.mp3,BUT NOWHERE COULD HE FIND HIS NEW COMPANION
cv-valid-test/sample-000948.mp3,AND HE DECIDED HE WOULD GO TO SEE THE CHIEFS OF THE TRIBES
cv-valid-test/sample-000949.mp3,LOOKING DOWN AT THE SPOON HE HELD THE BOY SAW THAT THE OIL WAS GONE
cv-valid-test/sample-000950.mp3,HER APARTMENT IS ON THE THIRD FLOOR
cv-valid-test/sample-000951.mp3,WHO ARE YOU HE HEARD A VOICE ASK HIM IN SPANISH
cv-valid-test/sample-000952.mp3,BRENDA PETER'S JUST ESCAPED FROM THE COUNTY JAIL
cv-valid-test/sample-000953.mp3,SHE JUST STEPPED OUT
cv-valid-test/sample-000954.mp3,THE TRADITION TEACHES MEN HOW TO CROSS THE DESERT AND HOW THEIR CHILDREN SHOULD MARRY
cv-valid-test/sample-000955.mp3,HE DRESSED IN HIS ARABIAN CLOTHING OF WHITE LINEN BOUGHT ESPECIALLY FOR THIS DAY
cv-valid-test/sample-000956.mp3,THEY SHOUTED CONSOLATION AND PROMISES AND WENT OFF BACK TO THE TOWN AGAIN TO GET HELP
cv-valid-test/sample-000957.mp3,IT'S LIKE THE FLIGHT OF THOSE TWO HAWKS IT CAN'T BE UNDERSTOOD BY REASON ALONE
cv-valid-test/sample-000958.mp3,MANY OF THEM HAD BEEN RIGHT ABOUT WHAT THEY SAID WHILE SOME HAD BEEN WRONG
cv-valid-test/sample-000959.mp3,HAVE A GOOD TRICK
cv-valid-test/sample-000960.mp3,SUDDENLY THERE IS SO MUCH MORE TIME IN A DAY BECAUSE SHE NO LONGER HAS TO SPEND HOURS COMMUTING
cv-valid-test/sample-000961.mp3,YOU'VE BEEN DOING MIGHTY GOOD WORK LATELY
cv-valid-test/sample-000962.mp3,ARE YOU TRYING TO SCOOP US OR SOMETHING
cv-valid-test/sample-000963.mp3,I SHOULD SAY NOUGHT
cv-valid-test/sample-000964.mp3,BUT HE APPEARED TO BE UNAWARE OF ANY DANGER
cv-valid-test/sample-000965.mp3,YOU ALREADY KNOW ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW
cv-valid-test/sample-000966.mp3,HENDERSON WAS TAKING IT IN
cv-valid-test/sample-000967.mp3,SOMETHING JUST FLEW BY
cv-valid-test/sample-000968.mp3,THE BOY FELL TO THE SAND NEARLY UNCONSCIOUS
cv-valid-test/sample-000969.mp3,THEY WAS BOTH TOO SMART FOR US
cv-valid-test/sample-000970.mp3,MY CHAMPOO IS MADE FROM COCOANUT AND SWEET ALMOND
cv-valid-test/sample-000971.mp3,WHY THE SHOTS STOPPED AFTER THE TEMTS NO ONE ON EARTH HAS TRIED TO EXPLAIN
cv-valid-test/sample-000972.mp3,I WOULD HAVE WON THE JUNIOR OLYMPICS IF NOT FOR THOSE MEDALING KIDS
cv-valid-test/sample-000973.mp3,MOST OF MY FRIENDS HAVE ALREADY FINISHED COLLEGE
cv-valid-test/sample-000974.mp3,CABLES NEED INSULATION TO PREVENT SHORT CIRCUITS
cv-valid-test/sample-000975.mp3,I WANT TO TELL YOUR STORY ABOUT RUTH SAID THE ALCHEMIST
cv-valid-test/sample-000976.mp3,SOMEHOW THE PARAGRAPHS BLEWD INTO EACH OTHER
cv-valid-test/sample-000977.mp3,WHAT'S SO DEPRESSING ABOUT THAT
cv-valid-test/sample-000978.mp3,HAPPE NEW YEAR TO YOU ALL
cv-valid-test/sample-000979.mp3,HE HEARD A MUFFLED GRATING SOUND AND SAW THE BLACK MARK JERK FORWARD AN INCH OR SO
cv-valid-test/sample-000980.mp3,SO WHEN I LOOK OUT OVER YOUR SANS I'M ALSO LOOKING AT HER
cv-valid-test/sample-000981.mp3,I HATE TO THINK WHAT HE'LL SAY
cv-valid-test/sample-000982.mp3,THESE FIGURES OF WAX LOOKED CREEPY
cv-valid-test/sample-000983.mp3,NOT EVERYONE CAN SEE HIS DREAMS COME TRUE IN THE SAME WAY
cv-valid-test/sample-000984.mp3,HE WAS ABLE TO GET ON HIS KNEES BUT HE QUICKLY SLIPPED BACK
cv-valid-test/sample-000985.mp3,THE METHOD DOES NOT HAVE TO BE THE BEST
cv-valid-test/sample-000986.mp3,I'M SURPRISED YOU DIDN'T RUN INTO HER
cv-valid-test/sample-000987.mp3,IT SPREAD THROUGH THE PLANET'S ATMOSPHERE AND OBSCURED ITS MORE FAMILIAR FEATURES
cv-valid-test/sample-000988.mp3,I KNOW WHY I WANT TO GET BACK TO MY FLOCK HE THOUGHT
cv-valid-test/sample-000989.mp3,THE HEATHER WAS ON FIRE AND YOU COULD SEE A THIN BLUE SMOKE RISING UP SLOWLY
cv-valid-test/sample-000990.mp3,THE SPACE WAS PARSON ALMOST BARE
cv-valid-test/sample-000991.mp3,AT THAT POINT IN THEIR LIVES EVERYTHING IS CLEAR AND EVERYTHING IS POSSIBLE
cv-valid-test/sample-000992.mp3,I TOLD YOU HER BOY SMILING AS BEEN PROSECUTORS
cv-valid-test/sample-000993.mp3,SOMETHING BRIGHT REFLECTED FROM HIS CHEST WITH SUCH INTENSITY THAT THE BOY WAS MOMENTARILY BLINDED
cv-valid-test/sample-000994.mp3,THOSE ARE THE RULES OF WAR THE LEADER EXPLAINED
cv-valid-test/sample-000995.mp3,THE NIGHT WAS WARM AND I WAS THIRSTY
cv-valid-test/sample-000996.mp3,FACTIAMA APPEARED AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE TENT
cv-valid-test/sample-000997.mp3,THE BOOK THAT MOST INTERESTED THE BOY TOLD THE STORIES OF THE FAMOUS ALCHEMISTS

cv-valid-test/sample-001074.mp3,HE FOLLOWED THE MOVEMENT OF THE BIRDS TRYING TO READ SOMETHING INTO IT
cv-valid-test/sample-001075.mp3,BEFORE GUNS WERE INVENTED ARMIES HAD TO THROW BULLETS AT EACH OTHER AND IF A BULLET TOUCHED YOU YOU HAD TO SIT OUT UNTIL THE NEXT WAR
cv-valid-test/sample-001076.mp3,I DON'T WANT TO CHANGE ANYTHING BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH CHANGE

cv-valid-test/sample-001088.mp3,EVERYONE SEEMED VERY EXCITED
cv-valid-test/sample-001089.mp3,IT'S ALMOST AS IF HE HAD BEEN HERE AND LEFT HIS MARK HE THOUGHT
cv-valid-test/sample-001090.mp3,IT WAS A FULL MOON AND THE BOY TOLD THE ENGLISHMAN THE STORY OF HIS LIFE
cv-valid-test/sample-001091.mp3,THE HORSE REARED AGAIN RAISING A CLOUD OF DUST
cv-valid-test/sample-001092.mp3,DID SHE DISCUSS IT WITH YOU

cv-valid-test/sample-001094.mp3,

cv-valid-test/sample-001096.mp3,THE BOY HAD NEVER EVEN NOTICED THAT THERE WAS A HOLE IN HIS POUCH
cv-valid-test/sample-001097.mp3,THE BOY FELT A PANG IN HIS HEART THINKING ABOUT THE MERCHANT'S DAUGHTER

cv-valid-test/sample-001104.mp3,IT MUST HAVE FALLEN WHILE I WAS SITTING OVER THERE
cv-valid-test/sample-001105.mp3,IT'S AS MUCH MY FAULT AS YOURS
cv-valid-test/sample-001106.mp3,AS NICE AS BLAKES
cv-valid-test/sample-001107.mp3,MAGTUB THOUGHT THE BOY
cv-valid-test/sample-001108.mp3,WHY WOULD THE KING BE TALKING WITH THE SHEPHERD THE BOY ASKED AWED AND EMBARRASSED

cv-valid-test/sample-001111.mp3,IT SAID THAT THE DARKEST HOUR OF THE NIGHT CAME JUST BEFORE THE DAWN
cv-valid-test/sample-001112.mp3,I THOUGHT THE ANSCREWING MIGHT BE AUTOMATIC

cv-valid-test/sample-001122.mp3,BRAND'S OPENING ATTACK ON THE GOVERNOR
cv-valid-test/sample-001123.mp3,I HEARD A PARTICULAR HUMMING SOUND FROM THE PIT
cv-valid-test/sample-001124.mp3,ENOUGH SAID THE BOY
cv-valid-test/sample-001125.mp3,IT'S JUST LIKE ANY OTHER DAY AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED
cv-valid-test/sample-001126.mp3,HE MUST BE DISGUISED TO AVOID ENCOUNTERS WITH THIEVES
cv-valid-test/sample-001127.mp3,THE BURNING FIRE HAD BEEN EXTINGUISHED
cv-valid-test/sample-001128.mp3,SHE LOOKS AS THOUGH SHE'S GOING TO COME TO
cv-valid-test/sample-001129.mp3,ELIZABETH CHARLES IS DEAD
cv-valid-test/sample-001130.mp3,IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE SHE LAST READ CIHOV AND BECAUSE OF THAT SHE NO LONGER FEELS LIKE THE HURRYING OF HER OWN STORY
cv-valid-test/sample-001131.mp3,YOU DON'T DENY THAT
cv-valid-test/sample-001132.mp3,THAT HE WANTED TO TRAVEL
cv-valid-test/sample-001133.mp3,HE WAS GOING TO MISS THE PLACE AND ALL THE GOOD THINGS HE HAD LEARNED
cv-valid-test/sample-001134.mp3,I WENT STRETCHING MY LEGS CLUMSILY AND FEELING MY WAY IN THE DARK
cv-valid-test/sample-001135.mp3,THEN THE THING CAME UPON HIM IN A FLASH
cv-valid-test/sample-001136.mp3,THE SUN THOUGHT FOR A MINUTE
cv-valid-test/sample-001137.mp3,HE CONDEMNED THE COMMANDER TO DEATH WITHOUT ANNOR
cv-valid-test/sample-001138.mp3,YOU SHOULD SEE THE OTHER GUY SPECIFICALLY HOW GOOD AT FIGHTING HE IS

cv-valid-test/sample-001141.mp3,BUT THEY WERE NOT THERE
cv-valid-test/sample-001142.mp3,I'M NOT GOING VERY FAR THE ALCHEMIST ANSWERED LOOKING STRAIGHT INTO THE EYES OF THE HORSEMAN
cv-valid-test/sample-001143.mp3,HE UNDERSTANDS THE FORCES OF NATURE
cv-valid-test/sample-001144.mp3,AFTER ALL WHO DOESN'T WANT TO OVERCOME NEW CHALLENGES AND ACHIEVE GREAT HEIGHTS
cv-valid-test/sample-001145.mp3,IT DIDN'T EVEN OCCUR TO THE BOY TO FLEE
cv-valid-test/sample-001146.mp3,BUT HORSES TIRED BIT BY BIT
cv-valid-test/sample-001147.mp3,EXCEPT FOR THE TRAN

cv-valid-test/sample-001152.mp3,HE DIDN'T WANT ANY CONVERSATION AT THIS POINT
cv-valid-test/sample-001153.mp3,NONE OF WHAT THE OLD MAN WAS SEEING MADE MUCH SENSE TO THE BOY
cv-valid-test/sample-001154.mp3,HE'S DOING IT BECAUSE IT'S WHAT HE WANTS TO DO
cv-valid-test/sample-001155.mp3,THE BOY COULD CERTAINLY RESIST CAUSING THAT KIND OF ANXIETY FOR THE BAKER
cv-valid-test/sample-001156.mp3,
cv-valid-test/sample-001157.mp3,OF COURSE THE TWO WERE UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING
cv-valid-test/sample-001158.mp3,THE OLD MAN WORE A BRISPLET OF GOLD AND HE KNEW ABOUT MY PAST

cv-valid-test/sample-001162.mp3,THIS MORNING I FOUND A CALCULATOR TAPED TO MY WEE
cv-valid-test/sample-001163.mp3,AND HE IMMEDIATELY FELT PEACE IN HIS HEART

cv-valid-test/sample-001249.mp3,CHICKENS ARE ADORABLE
cv-valid-test/sample-001250.mp3,CHRISTMAS IS A LOT LIKE EASTER

cv-valid-test/sample-001255.mp3,YOU'RE SINCERELY SECTAN
cv-valid-test/sample-001256.mp3,HE HAD SUDDENLY REMEMBERED THAT IN TARIFA THERE WAS AN OLD WOMAN WHO INTERPRETED DREAMS
cv-valid-test/sample-001257.mp3,OF COURSE I'VE KNEW YOU
cv-valid-test/sample-001258.mp3,THE BOY WAS SHOCKED
cv-valid-test/sample-001259.mp3,THE TENER FOUGHT IT WAS FINELY
cv-valid-test/sample-001260.mp3,THEY LOOKED OUT OVER THE DESERT THAT HAD BROUGHT HIM TO THE WOMAN HE LOVED
cv-valid-test/sample-001261.mp3,THE ANIMALS WERE EXHAUSTED AND THE MEN TALKED AMONG THEMSELVES LESS AND LESS
cv-valid-test/sample-001262.mp3,THE WIND BEGAN TO BLOW AGAIN
cv-valid-test/sample-001263.mp3,HE HAD SEEN THE SHOOTING STAR AND WAS PERSUADED THAT A METARITE LAY SOMEWHERE NEARBY
cv-valid-test/sample-001264.mp3,WHEN YOU ARE IN LOVE THINGS MAKE EVEN MORE SENSE HE THOUGHT
cv-valid-test/sample-001265.mp3,AFTER LUSELY TEFICTAL THE GINGERBREAD MEN OF COURSE TWO LIVE IN HOUSES MADE OF THEIR OWN FLESH
cv-valid-test/sample-001266.mp3,YOU HAVE HELPED ME THE MAN CONTINUED TO PREPARE HIS TEA SAYING NOTHING
cv-valid-test/sample-001267.mp3,I'VE GOT A WEAKNESS
cv-valid-test/sample-001268.mp3,THEY BOTH SPOKE THE SAME LANGUAGE
cv-valid-test/sample-001269.mp3,A LARGE PORTION OF THE CYLINDER HAD BEEN UNCOVERED
cv-valid-test/sample-001270.mp3,OGILVY TOLD HIM EVERYTHING THAT HE HAD SEEN
cv-valid-test/sample-001271.mp3,HE DIDN'T WANT ANY CONVERSATION AT THIS POINT
cv-valid-test/sample-001272.mp3,EVERYONE SEEMED VERY EXCITED
cv-valid-test/sample-001273.mp3,ONE CAN IMAGINE THESE TWO COVERED WITH SAND RUNNING UP THE LITTLE STREET IN THE BRIGHT SUNLIGHT
cv-valid-test/sample-001274.mp3,THEY CALLED THAT DISCOVERY THE MASTER WORK IT WAS PART LIQUID AND PART SOLID
cv-valid-test/sample-001275.mp3,THE ARAB ACCEPTED THEM WITHOUT A WORD
cv-valid-test/sample-001276.mp3,IT WAS ONLY WHEN I GOT THIS CLOSE TO IT THAT THE STRANGEST OF IT WAS ALL EVIDENT TO ME
cv-valid-test/sample-001277.mp3,AS HE WAS LEAVING HE SAW IN THE CORNER OF THE ROOM HIS OLD SHEPHERD'S POUCH
cv-valid-test/sample-001278.mp3,THAT'S WHAT ALCHEMISTS DO
cv-valid-test/sample-001279.mp3,THE QUICKER THE BETTER
cv-valid-test/sample-001280.mp3,HE CALLED TO THE BOY AND THEY TOOK A WALK ALONG THE DUWS SURROUNDING THE ENCAMPMENT
cv-valid-test/sample-001281.mp3,HE RE STARTED HIS APFOACH FOR THE TWENTIETH TIME
cv-valid-test/sample-001282.mp3,SHE GAVE THEM EACH A HALF TO MAKE THEM WORK TOGETHER
cv-valid-test/sample-001283.mp3,WHO GETS YOUR VOTE
cv-valid-test/sample-001284.mp3,THE ONLY SHADOW WAS THAT OF THE FEW SCATTERED PINE TREES
cv-valid-test/sample-001285.mp3,IT WAS PRAYED IN RED WITH YELLOW CANGES
cv-valid-test/sample-001286.mp3,ALL THEY THINK ABOUT IS FOOD AND WATER
cv-valid-test/sample-001287.mp3,MYLFENDYE I TELL
cv-valid-test/sample-001288.mp3,IT LEFT A GREENISH STREAK THAT GLOWED FOR SOME SECONDS
cv-valid-test/sample-001289.mp3,THE TREASUREIS AT THE PREMIS THAT YOU'RE ALREADY N YOU
cv-valid-test/sample-001290.mp3,THERE WAS VERY LITTLE TALKING
cv-valid-test/sample-001291.mp3,IT MUST BE SOME KIND OF A GAG
cv-valid-test/sample-001292.mp3,SOMETHING INSIDE THE CYLINDER WAS UNSCREWING THE TOP
cv-valid-test/sample-001293.mp3,I KNOW SHE WRITES THEM
cv-valid-test/sample-001294.mp3,I THINK THEY PERCEIVED THAT NOTHING WAS TO BE DONE AT THE MOMENT
cv-valid-test/sample-001295.mp3,IT WOULD KILL YOU
cv-valid-test/sample-001296.mp3,THE SUN TAUGHT ABOUT THAT AND DECIDED TO SHINE MORE BRIGHTLY
cv-valid-test/sample-001297.mp3,YOU'RE IN LUCK YOU TOO THE FAT ARAB SAID
cv-valid-test/sample-001298.mp3,IT WAS A BUNDLE OF MONEY
cv-valid-test/sample-001299.mp3,AND HE WASN'T FARING MUCH BETTER
cv-valid-test/sample-001300.mp3,MAYBE BECAUSE THAT WASN'T REALLY HIS DREAM
cv-valid-test/sample-001301.mp3,HE HAD NEVER EVEN WEPT IN FRONT OF HIS OWN SHEEP
cv-valid-test/sample-001302.mp3,NO DOUBT THE IMPACT HAD CAUSED A FLASH OF FIRE
cv-valid-test/sample-001303.mp3,BY THE LIGHT OF THEIR OWN DESTRUCTION I SAW THEM STAGGERING AND FALLING AND THEIR SUPPORTERS TURNING TO RUN
cv-valid-test/sample-001304.mp3,BUT DON'T WORRY THE ALCHEMIST CONTINUED
cv-valid-test/sample-001305.mp3,THEN TAKING HIS SHEEP HE WALKED AWAY
cv-valid-test/sample-001306.mp3,BEFORE THE BOY COULD REPLY A BUTTERFLY APPEARED AND FLUTTERED BETWEEN HIM AND THE OLD MAN
cv-valid-test/sample-001307.mp3,I SHALL MAKE US SOME OICT TUBES
cv-valid-test/sample-001308.mp3,IT WAS EARLY MORNING WHEN SHE WOKE UP
cv-valid-test/sample-001309.mp3,IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT IT FELL TO EARTH ABOUT ONE HUNDRED MILES EASTPEED
cv-valid-test/sample-001310.mp3,YOU'LL GET YOUR MONEY IN THE SIXTY DAYS
cv-valid-test/sample-001311.mp3,HE WAS PLANNING AS HE LEFT THE BAR
cv-valid-test/sample-001312.mp3,IT WAS A PLEASANT CHANGE FROM TALKING TO HIS SHEEP
cv-valid-test/sample-001313.mp3,NO HE HEARD A VOICE ON THE WIND SAYING
cv-valid-test/sample-001314.mp3,PATRICK HAS TERMINAL CANCER
cv-valid-test/sample-001315.mp3,THE SHOP IS EXACTLY THE SIZE I ALWAYS WANTED IT TO BE
cv-valid-test/sample-001316.mp3,IT LOOKED LIKE A RUSTY GAS FLOAT
cv-valid-test/sample-001317.mp3,WHAT IS THE BENEFIT OF THE METHOD IN TERMS OF ENEFICATIONED ACCURANCY
cv-valid-test/sample-001318.mp3,THERE'S NO DANGER THE BOY SAID WHEN THEY HAD MOVED ON PAST THE ENCAMPMENT
cv-valid-test/sample-001319.mp3,I HAD NEVER HEARD OF ALCHEMIST BEFORE THE BOY SAID
cv-valid-test/sample-001320.mp3,I MYSELF HEARD NOTHING OF THAT
cv-valid-test/sample-001321.mp3,A BOY CAME RUNNING TOWARDS ME
cv-valid-test/sample-001322.mp3,HE DREW ON THE BACK OF HIS JACKET WITH A BLUE FOUNTAIN PIN
cv-valid-test/sample-001323.mp3,THERE WERE THIRTY GIRLS ON THE SOCKER FIELD
cv-valid-test/sample-001324.mp3,THAT'S GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH IT
cv-valid-test/sample-001325.mp3,EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW YOU HAVE LEARNED THROUGH YOUR JOURNEY
cv-valid-test/sample-001326.mp3,IT WAS BETTER THAN THE SCENT OF THE HOOKAS
cv-valid-test/sample-001327.mp3,THE GUY THOUGHT HE WAS A LUNATICET LARGE MADE AN UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPT TO STOP HIM
cv-valid-test/sample-001328.mp3,I COULD EAT A HORSE
cv-valid-test/sample-001329.mp3,HE HEARD A MUFFLED GRATING SOUND AND SAW THE BLACK MARK JERK FORWARD AN INCH OR SO
cv-valid-test/sample-001330.mp3,WE NEED TO RUN
cv-valid-test/sample-001331.mp3,I TOLD YOU TO PRACTICE
cv-valid-test/sample-001332.mp3,ON THE FIRST DAY HE RETURNED WITH A RABBIT AND ON THE SECOND WITH TWO BIRDS
cv-valid-test/sample-001333.mp3,THE ONLY SHADOW WAS THAT OF THE FEW SCATTERED PINE TREES
cv-valid-test/sample-001334.mp3,FEW PEOPLE REALIZE THE IMMENSITY OF VACANCY
cv-valid-test/sample-001335.mp3,IT WAS THE PULE LANGUAGE OF THE GORD
cv-valid-test/sample-001336.mp3,ANOTHER TRICK THE BOY THOUGHT
cv-valid-test/sample-001337.mp3,SO HE COULD NOT BE HASTY NOR IMPATIENT
cv-valid-test/sample-001338.mp3,YOU WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO ESCAPE FROM YOUR HEART
cv-valid-test/sample-001339.mp3,IT HAD A DIAMENDER OF ABOUT THIRTY YARDS
cv-valid-test/sample-001340.mp3,HE TOOK BACK HIS BOOKS AND PACKED THEM AWAY AGAIN IN THEIR BAGS
cv-valid-test/sample-001341.mp3,YOU'VE GOT JUST TEN MINUTES
cv-valid-test/sample-001342.mp3,THAT SONG REMINDS ME OF MY CHILDHOOD
cv-valid-test/sample-001343.mp3,THE LITTLE GROUP OF PEOPLE FROM THE CITY DISPERSED
cv-valid-test/sample-001344.mp3,TWO YEARS AGO RIGHT HERE ON THIS SPOT I HAD A RECURRANT DREAM TOO
cv-valid-test/sample-001345.mp3,HE CALLED TO THE BOY AND THEY TOOK A WALK ALONG THE DUNES SURROUNDING THE ENCAMPMENT
cv-valid-test/sample-001346.mp3,WHEN SHE SAW THE UNKNOWN OBJECT BARBING UP AND DOWN THE EDGE SHE WAS ABSOLUTELY HORRIFIED
cv-valid-test/sample-001347.mp3,IT'S THE MASTER WORK OF THE ALCHEMISTS
cv-valid-test/sample-001348.mp3,TWO DAYS LATER THE MERCHANT SPOKE TO THE BOY ABOUT THE DISPLAY
cv-valid-test/sample-001349.mp3,BUT HE KEPT QUIET BECAUSE HE HAD HEARD WHAT THE ALCHEMIST SAID TO THE MONK
cv-valid-test/sample-001350.mp3,THE BOY BROUGHT HIS HORSE CLOSER
cv-valid-test/sample-001351.mp3,FATIMA APPEARED AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE TENT
cv-valid-test/sample-001352.mp3,THEN SUDDENLY HE NOTICED IT WITH A START
cv-valid-test/sample-001353.mp3,BUT THEY WERE NOT THERE
cv-valid-test/sample-001354.mp3,HAVE YOU NOTIFIED THE POLICE
cv-valid-test/sample-001355.mp3,I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE FEELING
cv-valid-test/sample-001356.mp3,TEN MINUTES FOR WHAT
cv-valid-test/sample-001357.mp3,WO'M I CALLING NOW
cv-valid-test/sample-001358.mp3,BUT THE MERCHANT UNDERSTOOD WHAT THE BOY HAD SAID
cv-valid-test/sample-001359.mp3,THE SOUL MUST BE TOO PLIMITIVE TO UNDERSTAND THOSE THINGSHE THOUGHT
cv-valid-test/sample-001360.mp3,WHO IS THIS STRANGER WHO SPEAKS OF OMENS ASKED ONE OF THE CHIEFTAINS EYEING THE BOY
cv-valid-test/sample-001361.mp3,THEN YOU'LL DIE IN THE MIDST OF TRYING TO REALIZE YOUR DESTINY
cv-valid-test/sample-001362.mp3,THE LEVEL GROUND WAS BLACKENED AS FAR AS ONE COULD SEE AND IT WAS STILL GIVING OFF SMOKE
cv-valid-test/sample-001363.mp3,THEY RODE FOR THE ENTIRE DAY
cv-valid-test/sample-001364.mp3,THEN HE TOOK FROM HIS KNAPSACK A BOTTLE OF WINE AND DRANK SOME
cv-valid-test/sample-001365.mp3,I WAS SENT DOWN HERE TO CLEAN HOUSE
cv-valid-test/sample-001366.mp3,HE WANTED YOUR MONEY HE SAID
cv-valid-test/sample-001367.mp3,IT WAS DROPPING OFF IN FLAKES AND RAINING DOWN ON THE SAND
cv-valid-test/sample-001368.mp3,I THINK WE WILL WRONG ABOUT SALLY HAVING THE MONEY
cv-valid-test/sample-001369.mp3,HE WAS TWENTY MINUTES FROM HIS TENT AND BEGAN TO MAKE HIS WAY THERE
cv-valid-test/sample-001370.mp3,IT WAS STARLIGHT AND I EXPLAINED THE SIGNS OF THE ZODIAC TOUR
cv-valid-test/sample-001371.mp3,I WANT MY HUSBAND TO WANDER AS FREE AS THE WIND THAT SHAPES THE DUNES
cv-valid-test/sample-001372.mp3,A BOY CAME RUNNING TOWARDS ME
cv-valid-test/sample-001373.mp3,YOU LIVED YOUR LIFE IN A LOVING WAY AND DIED WITH DIGNITY
cv-valid-test/sample-001374.mp3,HOW MUCH IS IT WORTH
cv-valid-test/sample-001375.mp3,I'LL JUST ORT IT HE SAID TO HIMSELF
cv-valid-test/sample-001376.mp3,I'M GOING TO HATE THOSE WHO HAVE FOUND THEIR TREASURE BECAUSE I NEVER FOUND MINE
cv-valid-test/sample-001377.mp3,THE BOY NOTICED THAT THE OWNER OF THE BAR STOOD NEARBY LISTENING ATTENTIVELY TO THEIR CONVERSATION
cv-valid-test/sample-001378.mp3,AND ONE OR TWO PERSONS WERE RETURNING
cv-valid-test/sample-001379.mp3,I THOUGHT THAT WAS PETER PARKER
cv-valid-test/sample-001380.mp3,BUT EVERYTHING HAD CHANGED
cv-valid-test/sample-001381.mp3,AN ALCHEMIST SAID THE ALCHEMIST
cv-valid-test/sample-001382.mp3,YE IT'S DEFINITELY WORTH CHECKING OUT ESPECIALLY IF THE PAY IS REASONABLE AND THE WORK IS GOOD FOR YOUR CAREERTHERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO REASON FOR HER TO ANNOUNCE IT TO THE ENTIRE COMPANY
cv-valid-test/sample-001383.mp3,I COULD SEE SOMETHING IN THEIR FACES
cv-valid-test/sample-001384.mp3,NO ONE SAID A WORD AS THE OLD MAN CONTINUED
cv-valid-test/sample-001385.mp3,HAVE YOU GOT THAT MONEY
cv-valid-test/sample-001386.mp3,THE BREEZE BEGAN TO BLOW
cv-valid-test/sample-001387.mp3,THE CLOTH WAS SLIGHTLY ASKEW
cv-valid-test/sample-001388.mp3,HERE'S TWO THOUS TO
cv-valid-test/sample-001389.mp3,I GOT DRUNK YESTERDAY AND THOUGHT I BUILT A SUPER COMPUTER
cv-valid-test/sample-001390.mp3,THEN THE THING CAME UPON HIM IN THE FLESH
cv-valid-test/sample-001391.mp3,I HAD THE DOT OF A KIND WHO FOUND TWENTY DOLLARS
cv-valid-test/sample-001392.mp3,SHE'S WRITTEN TO ME EVERY DAY SINCE
cv-valid-test/sample-001393.mp3,IT'S CALLED THE PRINCIPLE OF FAVORABILITY
cv-valid-test/sample-001394.mp3,ARECIDE WHAT THE YOUNG ARAB THE BOY WHO HAD SPOKEN WITH EARLIER
cv-valid-test/sample-001395.mp3,LET'S GO AND HAVE SOME LUNCH SAID THE GUISTAL MERCHANT
cv-valid-test/sample-001396.mp3,I HAVE HAD THIS SHOP FOR THIRTY YEARS
cv-valid-test/sample-001397.mp3,THERE WAS A MURMUR FROM THE CROWD
cv-valid-test/sample-001398.mp3,WELL THEN WHY DO WE NEED ALL THESE BOOKS THE BOY ASKED
cv-valid-test/sample-001399.mp3,THE BOY'S HEART BEGAN TO SPEAK OF HER
cv-valid-test/sample-001400.mp3,I HAD SEEN ALL THAT IT WOULD PRESENTLY BRING ME
cv-valid-test/sample-001401.mp3,BESIDES THAT THERE WAS A HEAP OF BICYCLES
cv-valid-test/sample-001402.mp3,MAYBE THAT'S WHY THEY ALWAYS STAY CLOSE TO ME
cv-valid-test/sample-001403.mp3,WHO'RE YOU HOLDING OUT ON
cv-valid-test/sample-001404.mp3,DON'T WORRY I TOOK A CAB TO GET HOME SAFELY
cv-valid-test/sample-001405.mp3,MY DOG MY DOG IS AN OWSEKIN A WE CALL HER POPPY
cv-valid-test/sample-001406.mp3,FROM ATOPIT'S WALLS ONE CAN CATCH A GLIMPSE OF ATHRICA
cv-valid-test/sample-001407.mp3,YOU'LL USE YOUR KNOWLEDGE FOR THE WELFARE OF THE OASIS AND ITS INHABITANTS
cv-valid-test/sample-001408.mp3,THAT SOBERED HIM A LITTLE
cv-valid-test/sample-001409.mp3,A THING IS TOO OVERWHELMING TO INTRODUCE TO COMPLEC TORS THAT BASELY DO THE SAME THINGS
cv-valid-test/sample-001410.mp3,YOU'VE GOT THE MAYA AND PULLMENT BACKED AGAINST THE WALL
cv-valid-test/sample-001411.mp3,THE MILT WAS REEN AND I WAS THIRSTY
cv-valid-test/sample-001412.mp3,AND HE GAVE THE BOY HIS BLESSING
cv-valid-test/sample-001413.mp3,WHAT'S IN THAT DESK
cv-valid-test/sample-001414.mp3,SO HE ASKED IF THE OLD MAN'S BLESSING WAS STILL WITH HIM
cv-valid-test/sample-001415.mp3,THE INVADERS CARRIED THE NAME EVERYWHERE THE BEAUTIFUL GIRL SPOKE OFER THE INVADERS WITH PRIDE
cv-valid-test/sample-001416.mp3,BUT THE BOY COULDN'T EVEN SPEAK
cv-valid-test/sample-001417.mp3,IT SEEMED HE HAD MADE THE LONG JOURNEY FOR NOTHING
cv-valid-test/sample-001418.mp3,WILL YOU GET OUT AND LET ME HANDLE THIS
cv-valid-test/sample-001419.mp3,OUR DEATLINE IS COMING UP RAPIDLY AND WE WILL NEED HELP
cv-valid-test/sample-001420.mp3,BUT THE DUSATION ALSO SERD THAT WE SHOULD REEAD THE MESSAGES OF THE DESERT
cv-valid-test/sample-001421.mp3,IT WOULD HAVE BEEN VISIBLE TO ME HAD I ONLY LOOKED UP AS IT PASSED
cv-valid-test/sample-001422.mp3,AT THE HIGHEST POINT IN TARIFA THERE IS AN OLD FOUR BUILT BY THE MOVERS
cv-valid-test/sample-001423.mp3,THERE WAS NO NEED TO IMPREVON THEM THEIR ARABS SIMPLY CONFISCATED THEIR HAUSES
cv-valid-test/sample-001424.mp3,ON A THREE O'CLOCK TRAIN
cv-valid-test/sample-001425.mp3,THEY ALSO BEGAN TO FEEL THAT THEY KNEW A BETTER WAY THAN OTHERS HAD
cv-valid-test/sample-001426.mp3,MEN DREAM MORE ABOUT COMING HOME THAN LEAVING THE BOY SAID
cv-valid-test/sample-001427.mp3,HE GOT UP EARLY WITH THE IDEA OF MINDING IT
cv-valid-test/sample-001428.mp3,BUT HE GROAN TO THE TRAVELLERS THREE DAYS
cv-valid-test/sample-001429.mp3,NO DOUBT THE IMPACT HAD CAUSED A FLASH OF FIRE
cv-valid-test/sample-001430.mp3,WHOSE TIME IS IT
cv-valid-test/sample-001431.mp3,HIRESTWO PERSONAL TRANNERS AND MAKE ONE OF THEM TRAIN THE OTHER ONE
cv-valid-test/sample-001432.mp3,DURING THE THIRD YEAR THE OMENS WILL CONTINUE TO SPEAK OF YOUR TREASURE AND YOUR DESTINY
cv-valid-test/sample-001433.mp3,AND HE WASN'T FARING MUCH BETTER
cv-valid-test/sample-001434.mp3,IT LEFT A GREENISH STREAK THAT GLOWED FOR SOME SECONDS
cv-valid-test/sample-001435.mp3,YOU'LL FIND US EVERYWHERE
cv-valid-test/sample-001436.mp3,IT WAS THE PURE LANGUAGE OF THE WORLD
cv-valid-test/sample-001437.mp3,THE BATTLES MAY LAST FOR A LONG TIME PERHAPS EVEN YEARS
cv-valid-test/sample-001438.mp3,IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT IT FELL TO EARTH ABOUT ONE HUNDRED MILES EAST OF HERE
cv-valid-test/sample-001439.mp3,NOT ASK WHY I DON'T KNOW WHY
cv-valid-test/sample-001440.mp3,MOST OF METEORISES ARE MORE OR LESS ROUNDED
cv-valid-test/sample-001441.mp3,LEARN TO RECOGNIZE OMENS AND FOLLOW THEM THE OLD KING HAD SAID
cv-valid-test/sample-001442.mp3,EVERYONE SEEMED VERY EXCITED
cv-valid-test/sample-001443.mp3,PERHAPS SHE MET SOMEBODY
cv-valid-test/sample-001444.mp3,LOOKING THROUGH THE TELESCOPE I SAW A CIRCLE OF DEEP BLUE IN THE LITTLE ROUND PLANET
cv-valid-test/sample-001445.mp3,THE SHEPHERD SWORE THE HEY WOOD
cv-valid-test/sample-001446.mp3,THAT LIFE MAY ALWAYS HAVE FLAVOR
cv-valid-test/sample-001447.mp3,NOT EVEN THE TRIBAL CHIEFTAINS ARE ABLE TO SEE HIM WHEN THEY WANT TO
cv-valid-test/sample-001448.mp3,THE ONLY SHADOW WAS THAT OF A FEW SCATTERED PINE TREES
cv-valid-test/sample-001449.mp3,AT THAT TIME IT WAS QUITE CLEAR IN MY OWN MIND THAT THE THING HAD COME FROM THE PLANET MARS
cv-valid-test/sample-001450.mp3,WE NEED TO HURRY
cv-valid-test/sample-001451.mp3,IT SPOKE OF JOURNEYS DISCOVERIES BOOKS IN CHANGE
cv-valid-test/sample-001452.mp3,HE WANTED TO FORGET ABOUT THE VISION AND RETURNED TO HIS MEDITATION
cv-valid-test/sample-001453.mp3,A THIN CIRCLE OF BRIGHT METAL SHOWED BETWEEN THE TOP AND THE BODY OF THE CYLINDER
cv-valid-test/sample-001454.mp3,IT'S GOING TO TAKE A WHILE THE BOY SAID
cv-valid-test/sample-001455.mp3,THEN THE TINT CAME UPON HIM IN A FLESH
cv-valid-test/sample-001456.mp3,IT SOUNDED LIKE A GYPSY PRAIR
cv-valid-test/sample-001457.mp3,I'M GOING TO FIND THAT DAMNED ALCHEMIST THE ENGLISHMAN THOUGHT
cv-valid-test/sample-001458.mp3,IN SPITE OF THIS I STILL BELIEVED THAT THEYE WERE MAN IN MILES
cv-valid-test/sample-001459.mp3,GIRSHLEY TRIED TO FIND HIM ON THEIR OWN
cv-valid-test/sample-001460.mp3,HE SAW THE BOY APPEAR FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DUNES
cv-valid-test/sample-001461.mp3,THE BOY WAITED AND THEN INTERRUPTED THE OLD MAN JUST AS HE HIMSELF HAD BEEN INTERRUPTED
cv-valid-test/sample-001462.mp3,WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S IN THE CONFOUNDED THENE DO YOU
cv-valid-test/sample-001463.mp3,OF COURSE THE TWO WERE UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING
cv-valid-test/sample-001464.mp3,WE SHOULD SEGREGATE THE PARTICIPANTS BY AGE
cv-valid-test/sample-001465.mp3,THEN WE CAN CLIMB MOUNT HELEN
cv-valid-test/sample-001466.mp3,AND MAYBE IT WASN'T THAT THEY WERE TEACHING ME BUT THAT I WAS LEARNING FROM THEM
cv-valid-test/sample-001467.mp3,HE WANDERED FOR A WHILE KEEPING THE DATE PALMS OF THE OASIS WITHIN SIGHT
cv-valid-test/sample-001468.mp3,IT WAS BETTER THAN THE SCENTE OF THE HOOKAS
cv-valid-test/sample-001469.mp3,SCATTERED GROUPS OF PEOPLE WERE HURRYING FROM THE DIRECTION OF WOKIN
cv-valid-test/sample-001470.mp3,AND THE ALCHEMIST UNDERSTOOD THAT THE BOY'S HEART HAD RETURNED TO THE SOUL OF THE WORLD
cv-valid-test/sample-001471.mp3,THE WAR CONTINUED AND AT TIMES THE WIND CARRIED THE SWEET SICKLY SMELL OF BLOOD
cv-valid-test/sample-001472.mp3,I TOLD HIM WE COULD TEACH HER TO IGNORE PEOPLE WHO WASTE HER TIME
cv-valid-test/sample-001473.mp3,TO REALIZE ONE'S DESTINY IS A PERSON'S ONLY REAL OBLIGATION
cv-valid-test/sample-001474.mp3,WHO ARE YOU HERED A VOICE ASK HIM IN SPANISH
cv-valid-test/sample-001475.mp3,THE PROTEPRODUCE A SHOWING HOW
cv-valid-test/sample-001476.mp3,YES WERE EVEN SEARCH FOR TREASURE
cv-valid-test/sample-001477.mp3,IN THOSE DAYS VERY FEW OF THE PEOPLE HAD ANY IDEA ABOUT ASTRONOMY
cv-valid-test/sample-001478.mp3,AND HE HADN'T PURSUED THEM BECAUSE HE HAD BECOME ACCUSTOMED TO THEM
cv-valid-test/sample-001479.mp3,THEN I DON'T GET PAID
cv-valid-test/sample-001480.mp3,SHE ACCUSED AN EXT CONVICT OF STALKING AND SEXUAL THE SALT
cv-valid-test/sample-001481.mp3,THEN I'VE ONLY GONTE OUT OF THE QUEST
cv-valid-test/sample-001482.mp3,THE STREAMER OF GAS CAME OUT TOWARDS US
cv-valid-test/sample-001483.mp3,IF YOU HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL THE WAR IS OVER THEN WAIT
cv-valid-test/sample-001484.mp3,HE THOUGHT OF THE WOMAN WHO HAD TRUSTED IN THE DESERT
cv-valid-test/sample-001485.mp3,THE PILOTS BRACED THEMSELVES FOR IMPACT
cv-valid-test/sample-001486.mp3,MOST OF THEM WERE STARING QUIETLY AT THE BIG TABLE
cv-valid-test/sample-001487.mp3,THE MEN OF THE DESERT WERE ALREADY FAMILIAR WITH THAT MIND
cv-valid-test/sample-001488.mp3,I HEARD A FAINT MOVEMENT UNDER MY FEET
cv-valid-test/sample-001489.mp3,DOWN BELOW IN THE DARKNESS WERE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE SLEEPING IN PEACE
cv-valid-test/sample-001490.mp3,ADYOU LAKER
cv-valid-test/sample-001491.mp3,A SIGHT FOR SORE EYES
cv-valid-test/sample-001492.mp3,THE MERCHANT WAS SILENT FOR A FEW MOMENTS
cv-valid-test/sample-001493.mp3,I'LL GIVE IT A DRINK
cv-valid-test/sample-001494.mp3,HOW LONG IS WHAT
cv-valid-test/sample-001495.mp3,THE ALCHEMIST WAS A BIT DAUNTING BUT AS THE BOY DRANK THE WINE HE RELAXED
cv-valid-test/sample-001496.mp3,THE BOY WENT TO HIS ROOM AND PACKED HIS BELONGINGS
cv-valid-test/sample-001497.mp3,THERE WERE LIGHTS IN THE UPPER WINDOWS OF THE HOUSES WHEN THE PEOPLE WENT TO BED
cv-valid-test/sample-001498.mp3,REMEMBER THE INTERVIEW I ROLD WITH ALISE WARMEN
cv-valid-test/sample-001499.mp3,HOW DO YOU MEAN

cv-valid-test/sample-001504.mp3,TAKE THAT FIRE EXTINGUISHER AND PUT OUT THE FIRE
cv-valid-test/sample-001505.mp3,OTHERS STUMBLED UPON THE STONE BY ACCIDENT
cv-valid-test/sample-001506.mp3,AT THAT TIME IT WAS QUITE CLEAR IN MY OWN MIND THAT THE THING HAD COME FROM THE PANIC MASS
cv-valid-test/sample-001507.mp3,AND HE GAVE THE BOY HIS BLESSING
cv-valid-test/sample-001508.mp3,STICK TO YOUR CLUBS
cv-valid-test/sample-001509.mp3,MY FRIEND BOUGHT ALL THE OTHER SHEEP IMMEDIATELY
cv-valid-test/sample-001510.mp3,LAST TIME I MADE THE MISTAKE OF REPLICATING A DRAWING BY ODA
cv-valid-test/sample-001511.mp3,TAKING THE JACKET OUT HE BEGAN TO CLEAM WITH LASSEN
cv-valid-test/sample-001512.mp3,HE HOPED THAT IT WOULD BE SOMEONE AS CAPABLE AS HIS PREVIOUS APPRENTICE
cv-valid-test/sample-001513.mp3,THE TURF AND GRAVEL AROUND IT SEEMED CHARRED AS IF BY A SUDDEN EXPLOSION
cv-valid-test/sample-001514.mp3,THE SHOT OFF MA BACK
cv-valid-test/sample-001515.mp3,THE DESERT WITH ITS ENDLESS MONOTONY PUT HIM TO DREAMING
cv-valid-test/sample-001516.mp3,IT'S A BEAUTIFUL MIRACLE
cv-valid-test/sample-001517.mp3,SHE LOOKS CAN OF BOARD
cv-valid-test/sample-001518.mp3,SHE'S A FICTY LITTLE FURRET
cv-valid-test/sample-001519.mp3,IT'S THE NAME OF THE PROPET'S DAUGHTER PAFRIMA SAID
cv-valid-test/sample-001520.mp3,THE TERRORIST GROUP MADE THEIR DEMAND
cv-valid-test/sample-001521.mp3,BUT THEY WERE NOT THERE
cv-valid-test/sample-001522.mp3,AND SO DO I
cv-valid-test/sample-001523.mp3,I WAS IMPATIENT TO SEE IT OPENED
cv-valid-test/sample-001524.mp3,HE EXPERTLY DUTTED THE RABBIT
cv-valid-test/sample-001525.mp3,AS THEY BEGAN TO DECORATE THE HALLWAY A SILHOUETTE APPEARED IN THE DOORWAY
cv-valid-test/sample-001526.mp3,WHEN DID YOU ARRIVE IN TOWN
cv-valid-test/sample-001527.mp3,AN IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE IS THE AMOUNT OF EXPERIENCES THAT IS TO SAY IN PUTS
cv-valid-test/sample-001528.mp3,BECAUSE YOU 'RE TRYING TO REALIZE YOUR DESTINY
cv-valid-test/sample-001529.mp3,A LINE OF FLAME HIGH CAN BE SEEN IN THE ATMOSPHERE
cv-valid-test/sample-001530.mp3,THE TURF AND GRAVEL AROUND IT SEEMED CHARRED AS IF BY A SUDDEN EXPLOSION
cv-valid-test/sample-001531.mp3,THIS WAS THE STRANGEST OF ALL THINGS THAT HAD EVER COME TO EARTH FROM OUTER SPACE
cv-valid-test/sample-001532.mp3,SO WHEN I LOOK OUT OVER YOUR SANDS I AM ALSO LOOKING AT HER
cv-valid-test/sample-001533.mp3,WOULD YOU LIKE A CAPUCH YOU KNOW

cv-valid-test/sample-001535.mp3,BINALL LOVELY CHAP
cv-valid-test/sample-001536.mp3,THEN THE THING CAME UPON HIM IN A FLASH
cv-valid-test/sample-001537.mp3,HE HAD SUDDENLY REMEMBERED THAT IN TARIFA THERE WAS AN OLD WOMAN WHO INTERPRETED DREAMS
cv-valid-test/sample-001538.mp3,THE BOY NOTICED THAT THE MAN'S CLOTHING WAS STRANGE
cv-valid-test/sample-001539.mp3,TOMORROW AT THIS SAME TIME BRING ME A TENTH OF YOUR FLOCK
cv-valid-test/sample-001540.mp3,IU CAN SEE THAT
cv-valid-test/sample-001541.mp3,THE ALCHEMIST WAS A BIT DAUNTING BUT AS THE BOY DRANK THE WINE HE RELAXED
cv-valid-test/sample-001542.mp3,THERE WERE RAISED VOICES AND SOME SORT OF STRUGGLE APPEARED TO BE GOING ON
cv-valid-test/sample-001543.mp3,CLASS WAS DISMISSED DUE TO A FREAK INCIDENT CAUSED BY A CHEMICAL SPILL
cv-valid-test/sample-001544.mp3,IT WAS DIFFICULT NOT TO THINK ABOUT WHAT HE HAD LEFT BEHIND
cv-valid-test/sample-001545.mp3,MY REVIEW OF THE SUN ONE STAR
cv-valid-test/sample-001546.mp3,IT DIDN'T EVEN OCCUR TO THE BOY TO FLEE
cv-valid-test/sample-001547.mp3,BUT SHE IS GONE
cv-valid-test/sample-001548.mp3,I DON'T BELIEVE IT
cv-valid-test/sample-001549.mp3,HE SPENT THE ENTIRE MORNING OBSERVING THE INFREQUENT COMINGS AND GOINGS IN THE STREET
cv-valid-test/sample-001550.mp3,YOU CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S NOT FADDER
cv-valid-test/sample-001551.mp3,SUDDENLY THE ELDER AT THE CENTRE SMILED ALMOST IMPERCEPTIBLY AND THE BOY FELT BETTER
cv-valid-test/sample-001552.mp3,HE DID FIND IT SOON AFTER DAWNNOT FAR FROM THE SAND PITS
cv-valid-test/sample-001553.mp3,ITS LOWER END WAS STILL EMBEDDED
cv-valid-test/sample-001554.mp3,THEN SUDDENLY HE NOTICED IT WITH A STARTT
cv-valid-test/sample-001555.mp3,IF YOU START YOU AMELS WITH GREATINS LET ME BE THE FIRST WHO WELCOME YOU TO EARTH
cv-valid-test/sample-001556.mp3,I GUESS I USED ALL THE SHELLS
cv-valid-test/sample-001557.mp3,THEY CAN'T DO THAT TO ME
cv-valid-test/sample-001558.mp3,AS I WATCHED THE PLANET SEEMED TO GROW LARGER AND SMALLER
cv-valid-test/sample-001559.mp3,AND YET NONE OF THESE PEOPLE HAS EVER MET THE OLD KING
cv-valid-test/sample-001560.mp3,HE DISAPPEARED INTO THE TENT
cv-valid-test/sample-001561.mp3,HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO WANT FROM ME
cv-valid-test/sample-001562.mp3,THIS WAS MY DESTINY NOT YOURS THE ALCHEMIST ANSWERED
cv-valid-test/sample-001563.mp3,LATER WE SIMPLY TET LIFE PROCEED IN ITS OWN DIRECTION TOWARDS ITS OWN FEET
cv-valid-test/sample-001564.mp3,A PILE OF SOFT ASHES COATED HER BODY AND FILLED HER NOSTRILS
cv-valid-test/sample-001565.mp3,THEN CAME THE NIGHT OF THE FIRST FALLING STAR
cv-valid-test/sample-001566.mp3,OF COURSE THE TWO WERE UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING
cv-valid-test/sample-001567.mp3,YOU MUST ALWAYS KNOW WHAT IT IS THAT YOU WANT THE OLD KING HAD SAID
cv-valid-test/sample-001568.mp3,THEYW'LL SAY THAT YO'VE SEE SPEND THEIR LIGHTS TREAKING OTHERS
cv-valid-test/sample-001569.mp3,HE WANTED TO TELL HIM ABOUT FATIMA
cv-valid-test/sample-001570.mp3,AT MOST THEY THOUGHT THAT ANOTHER METEORITE HAD DESCENDED
cv-valid-test/sample-001571.mp3,AS THEY SAT DOWN AT THE ONLY TABLE IN THE PLACE THE CRYSTAL MERCHANT LAGHED
cv-valid-test/sample-001572.mp3,THE GOD SHOULD NOT HAVE DESIRES BECAUSE THEY DON'D HAVE DESTINIES
cv-valid-test/sample-001573.mp3,IF YOU STAT YOUR EMAILS WITH GREETINGS LET ME BE THE FIRST TO WELCOME YOU TO EARTH
cv-valid-test/sample-001574.mp3,MACK TUB THOUGHT THE BOY

cv-valid-test/sample-001576.mp3,SADLY MY DREAM OF BECOMING A SQUIRREL WHISPERER MAY NEVER HAPPEN
cv-valid-test/sample-001577.mp3,I'M OBSERVING PASSIVE AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR THE PSYCHOLOGIST SAID IN A PROFESSIONAL TONE
cv-valid-test/sample-001578.mp3,THE CAMEL DRIVER UNDERSTOOD WHAT THE BOY WAS SAYING
cv-valid-test/sample-001579.mp3,THAT FIRST DAY EVERYONE SLEPT FROM EXHAUSTION INCLUDING THE ENGLISHMAN
cv-valid-test/sample-001580.mp3,THAT'S THE MAN WHO KNOWS ALL THE SECRETS OF THE WORLD SHE SAID
cv-valid-test/sample-001581.mp3,HOW DO PEOPLE CELEBRATE GOOD WEATHER OVER THERE
cv-valid-test/sample-001582.mp3,I JUST GOT RID OF ONE CROWD
cv-valid-test/sample-001583.mp3,AND I WILL TELL YOU HOW TO FIND THE HIDDEN TREASURE
cv-valid-test/sample-001584.mp3,THEY ALSO BEGAN TO FEEL THAT THEY KNEW A BETTER WAY THAN OTHERS HAD
cv-valid-test/sample-001585.mp3,SINS FOR THE CLARIFICATION
cv-valid-test/sample-001586.mp3,FATIMAN WAS MORE IMPORTANT THAN HIS TREASURE
cv-valid-test/sample-001587.mp3,AND BECAUSE THE TRIBES DECLARED WAR I WENT TO THE WELL SEEKING THE ALCHEMIST
cv-valid-test/sample-001588.mp3,WHEN THE SIMMUM CEASED TO BLOW EVERYONE LOOKED TO THE PLACE WHERE THE BOY HAD BEE
cv-valid-test/sample-001589.mp3,THE BOY LOOKED OUT AT THE HORIZON
cv-valid-test/sample-001590.mp3,NO DOUBT THE IMPECT HAD CAUSED A FLESH OF FIRE
cv-valid-test/sample-001591.mp3,EVEN ME I HAVEN'T THOUGHT OF OTHER WOMEN SINCE I MET THE MERCHANT'S DAUGHTER
cv-valid-test/sample-001592.mp3,I RAISE THEIR CLOUSES IN THE ALCA
cv-valid-test/sample-001593.mp3,HIS LIFE AND HIS PATH HAD ALWAYS PROVIDED HIM WITH ENOUGH OMENS
cv-valid-test/sample-001594.mp3,HE CALLED TO THE BOY AND THEY TOOK A WALK ALONG THE TUNES SURROUNDING THE ENCAMPMENT
cv-valid-test/sample-001595.mp3,THE REPORT WAS LARGELY SKATING
cv-valid-test/sample-001596.mp3,AND THEN HE PERCEIVED IT VERY SLOWLY
cv-valid-test/sample-001597.mp3,THAT'S THE BEST PART OF IT
cv-valid-test/sample-001598.mp3,I TORE HIM APART
cv-valid-test/sample-001599.mp3,SOME OF OUR BIGGEST CLIENTS ARE AFFECTED
cv-valid-test/sample-001600.mp3,I'M GOING TO THEM
cv-valid-test/sample-001601.mp3,THE ENGLISHMAN WAS DISAPPOINTED

cv-valid-test/sample-001603.mp3,WE MISS YOU AND HAVING A FRIEND LIKE YOU AND I'M SO HAPPY THAT YOU TOO GOT TO CATCH UB
cv-valid-test/sample-001604.mp3,SO THE WIND BLEW WITH ALL ITS STRENGTH AND THE SKY WAS FILLED WITH SOUND

cv-valid-test/sample-001606.mp3,GOLD NIGHT HELP YOU
cv-valid-test/sample-001607.mp3,I CAME TO TELL YOU JUST ONE THING THE BOY SAID
cv-valid-test/sample-001608.mp3,IT WOULD HAVE BEEN VISIBLE TO ME HOW THEY ALL LOOKED UP AS IPRESSED
cv-valid-test/sample-001609.mp3,WELL HE THOUGHT ABOUT THAT THE OLD MAN SAID
cv-valid-test/sample-001610.mp3,BUT THE CRYSTAL MERCHANT HAD NO CHOICE
cv-valid-test/sample-001611.mp3,THEY ATE IN SILENCE
cv-valid-test/sample-001612.mp3,THE CARAVANS HAD BEEN STOPPED AT GIZA FOR SOME TIME WAITING FOR THE WARS TO END
cv-valid-test/sample-001613.mp3,HE ASKED IT PLEASE NEVER TO STOP SPEAKING TO HIM
cv-valid-test/sample-001614.mp3,THE WIND BEGAN TO PICK UP
cv-valid-test/sample-001615.mp3,THEY WENT TO THE KITCHEN AT THE BACK OF THE MONASTERY
cv-valid-test/sample-001616.mp3,I HAVE TO SEPARATE OUT THE SULPUR
cv-valid-test/sample-001617.mp3,AND HE WASN'T FARING MUCH BETTER
cv-valid-test/sample-001618.mp3,DID YOU LEARN ANYTHING THE ENGLISHMAN ASKED EAGER TO HEAR WHAT IT MIGHT BE
cv-valid-test/sample-001619.mp3,THE SWEETCORN TASTED BETTER GRILLED
cv-valid-test/sample-001620.mp3,IT WOULD HAVE BEEN VISIBLE TO ME HAD I ONLY LOOKED UP AS IT PASSED
cv-valid-test/sample-001621.mp3,INSTEAD THE STRANGER LOWERED IT SLOWLY UNTIL THE POINT TOUCHED THE BOY'S FOREHEAD
cv-valid-test/sample-001622.mp3,AS SOON AS HE SAW ME AMOUNT THE CLOAT HE CALLED TO ME TO COME DOWN
cv-valid-test/sample-001623.mp3,AND HE GAVE THE BOY HIS BLESSING
cv-valid-test/sample-001624.mp3,BEFORE HE GETS THROUGH TONIGHT HE'LL RUIN US ALL
cv-valid-test/sample-001625.mp3,SHOULD I UNDERSTAND THE EMERALD TABLET THE BOY ASKED
cv-valid-test/sample-001626.mp3,WAIT TILL THOSE TWO FUTURE JAIL BIRDS READ THE MORNING POST TOMORROW
cv-valid-test/sample-001627.mp3,THEN THE TWO WENT OFF TO HAVE SOME MORE TEA
cv-valid-test/sample-001628.mp3,SHE NEEDS TO GET HER TRANSCRIPTS AND PASSPORT FIRST
cv-valid-test/sample-001629.mp3,THE BOY NOTICED THAT THE OWNER OF THE BAR STOOD NEARBY LISTENING ATTENTIVELY TO THEIR CONVERSATION
cv-valid-test/sample-001630.mp3,THE SERPENT RELAXED IMMEDIATELY
cv-valid-test/sample-001631.mp3,I CAN CLEAN UP THOSE GLASSES IN THE RUNDOW IF YOU'R RANK SAID THE BOY
cv-valid-test/sample-001632.mp3,HE THOUGHT OF THE WOMAN WHO HAD TRUSTED IN THE DESERT
cv-valid-test/sample-001633.mp3,THE TOP HAD CERTAINLY CEASED TO ROTATE
cv-valid-test/sample-001634.mp3,AND I'M CERTAIN YOU'LL FIND IT THE ALCHEMIST SAID
cv-valid-test/sample-001635.mp3,A WHILE AGO I WROTE THROUGH THE DESERT WITH A MAN WHO HAD BOOKS ON ALCHEMY
cv-valid-test/sample-001636.mp3,HE SLIPPED ON THE STAIRS
cv-valid-test/sample-001637.mp3,IT MUST HAVE FALLEN WHILE I WAS SITTING OVER THERE
cv-valid-test/sample-001638.mp3,THE FIRST RULE OF DON'T FIGHT CLUB IS LET'S TALK ABOUT IT
cv-valid-test/sample-001639.mp3,IT WAS THE MOST DELICIOUS WINE HE HAD EVER TASTED
cv-valid-test/sample-001640.mp3,NO DOUBT THE IMPACT HAS CROSSED A FLASH OF FIRE
cv-valid-test/sample-001641.mp3,THE ALCHEMIST DISMOUNTED SLOWLY AND THE BOY DID THE SAME
cv-valid-test/sample-001642.mp3,I WAS TORN BETWEEN FEAR AND CURIOSITY
cv-valid-test/sample-001643.mp3,HIS SOUL MUST BE TOO PRIMITIVE TO UNDERSTAND THOSE THINGS HE THOUGHT
cv-valid-test/sample-001644.mp3,WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT MIRANDA
cv-valid-test/sample-001645.mp3,THE BOY WENT TO THE WELL EVERY DAY TO MEET WITH FATIMA
cv-valid-test/sample-001646.mp3,IT SPREAD THROUGH THE PLANET'S ATMOSPHERE AND OBSCURRED ITS MORE FAMILIAR FEATURES
cv-valid-test/sample-001647.mp3,KEEP YOUR SHIRT ON
cv-valid-test/sample-001648.mp3,WHERE YOUR TREASURE IS THERE ALSO WILL BE YOUR HEART THE ALCHEMIST HAD TOLD HIM

cv-valid-test/sample-001650.mp3,THEN WHO ARE YOU
cv-valid-test/sample-001651.mp3,HE APPEARED WITH THE FIRST STARS OF EVENING
cv-valid-test/sample-001652.mp3,I HAVEN'T ANY HEARTFIELDINGS

cv-valid-test/sample-001654.mp3,HAVE RESTED MORE IN YOUR LOVE FOR FATIMA
cv-valid-test/sample-001655.mp3,WHEN WERE THESE BOOKS WRITTEN THE BOY ASKED

cv-valid-test/sample-001657.mp3,NOT THAT I WAS LISTENING BUT I NOTICED THAT YOU FOUND ID REALLY STRESSED WHEN YOU WERE EXPLAINING THIS SITUATION TO HIM
cv-valid-test/sample-001658.mp3,WHAT IS A FOREIGNER DOING HERE ASKED ANOTHER OF THE MEN
cv-valid-test/sample-001659.mp3,BUT WHEN THE REIGN OF TIBERIUS ENDED HIS POEMS WERE FORGOTTEN
cv-valid-test/sample-001660.mp3,BECAUSE LIFE WANTS YOU TO ACHIEVE YOUR DESTINY
cv-valid-test/sample-001661.mp3,WANT TO WALK TO NEW YORK
cv-valid-test/sample-001662.mp3,AT MORS THEY THOUGHT THAT ANOTHER METEORITE HAVE DESCENDED
cv-valid-test/sample-001663.mp3,I LEFT MY FATHER MY MOTHER AND THE TOWN CASTLE BEHIND

cv-valid-test/sample-001671.mp3,O ENGINEERED THIS GET AWAY
cv-valid-test/sample-001672.mp3,WHEN HE SAW HENDERSON IN HIS GARDEN HE COLLED OVER THE FENCE AND MADE HIMSELF UNDERSTOOD
cv-valid-test/sample-001673.mp3,IT LEFT A GREENISH STREAK THAT GLOWED FOR SOME SECONDS
cv-valid-test/sample-001674.mp3,WE'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING
cv-valid-test/sample-001675.mp3,THEN HE DROPPED HIS SPADE PICKED UP HIS JACKET AND CAME OUT INTO THE ROAD
cv-valid-test/sample-001676.mp3,THEY FILLED THREE SACKS
cv-valid-test/sample-001677.mp3,THE DESERT DIDN'T ANSWER HIM FOR A FEW MOMENTS
cv-valid-test/sample-001678.mp3,NEXT MORNING THERE WERE TWO THOUSAND ARMED MEN SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THE PALM TREES OF AL FAYUM
cv-valid-test/sample-001679.mp3,AND HE ASKED THE BOY IF HE TOO WERE IN SEARCH OF THE ALCHEMIST
cv-valid-test/sample-001680.mp3,ONLY IN THAT WAY WOULD HE BE ABLE TO READ THE OMENS
cv-valid-test/sample-001681.mp3,ONE THAT WILL WRITE
cv-valid-test/sample-001682.mp3,FROM HEREON YOU WILL BE ALONE THE ALCHEMIST SAID
cv-valid-test/sample-001683.mp3,I UNDERSTAND SHEEP THEY'RE NO LONGER A PROBLEM AND THEY CAN BE GOOD FRIENDS
cv-valid-test/sample-001684.mp3,IT WAS AS IF IT QUIVERED BUT REALLY THIS WAS A TELESCOPE VIBRATING
cv-valid-test/sample-001685.mp3,EVERYDAY WAS THERE TO BELIEVED OUGHT TO MARK ONE'S DEPARTURE FROM THIS WORLD
cv-valid-test/sample-001686.mp3,HE TRIED AGAIN TO CONCENTRATE ON THE PINK SHADES OF THE DESERT AND ITS STONES

cv-valid-test/sample-001689.mp3,SOMETHING ANSAY THE CYLINDER WAS UNSCREWING THEIR TOP
cv-valid-test/sample-001690.mp3,THE HOOKAS WERE EXTINGUISHED AND THE GUARDS STOOD OUT F ATTENTION
cv-valid-test/sample-001691.mp3,ALL THAT TIME THE MARTIANSE MUST HAVE BEEN GETTING READY
cv-valid-test/sample-001692.mp3,FROM THE RAILWAY STATION AT THE DISTANCE CAME THE SOUND OF TRAINS RINGING AND RUMBLING
cv-valid-test/sample-001693.mp3,THAT WAS THE LAW OF HOSPITALITY
cv-valid-test/sample-001694.mp3,THAT FIRST DAY EVERYONE SLEPT FROM EXHAUSTION INCLUDING THE ENGLISHMAN
cv-valid-test/sample-001695.mp3,BUT SHE SAID NOTHING

cv-valid-test/sample-001697.mp3,THE STRANGE HORSEMAN DREW AN ENORMOUS CURVED SWORD FROM A SCABBARD MOUNTED ON HIS SADDLE
cv-valid-test/sample-001698.mp3,I DON'T WANT TO CHANGE ANYTHING BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH CHANGE
cv-valid-test/sample-001699.mp3,BHEN DIDN'T CARE
cv-valid-test/sample-001700.mp3,I GOT DRUNK YESTERDAY AND THOUGHT I BUILT A SUPER COMPUTER
cv-valid-test/sample-001701.mp3,AND HE TOLD WHAT HE HAD SEEN
cv-valid-test/sample-001702.mp3,HE HAD BEEN SO FAR AWAY THAT HIS FACE WASN'T EVEN VISIBLE
cv-valid-test/sample-001703.mp3,THE ONLY SHADOW WAS THAT OF THE FEW SCATTERED PINE TREES
cv-valid-test/sample-001704.mp3,I FINALLY HAVE ENOUGH MONEY AND ALL THE TIME I NEED
cv-valid-test/sample-001705.mp3,THE CEILING COLLAPSED IN WOODS

cv-valid-test/sample-001714.mp3,MAYBE WE'D BETTER CALL HERMIN
cv-valid-test/sample-001715.mp3,IT WAS HOWEVER STILL SO HOT FROM ITS FLIGHT THROUGH THE AIR
cv-valid-test/sample-001716.mp3,THE OLD MAN SAID NOTHING
cv-valid-test/sample-001717.mp3,IT'S EVEN HIGHER THAN THIS
cv-valid-test/sample-001718.mp3,THE STRANGER SEEMED SATISFIED WITH THE ANDLER
cv-valid-test/sample-001719.mp3,I'M AFRAID THIS IS IMPORTANT
cv-valid-test/sample-001720.mp3,NOBODY'S TRYING TO STEAL FROM YOU
cv-valid-test/sample-001721.mp3,I WANT TO TELL YOU A STORY ABOUT DREAMS SAID THE ALCHEMIST
cv-valid-test/sample-001722.mp3,THE OLD MAN LOOKED DISAPPOINTED
cv-valid-test/sample-001723.mp3,BUT I FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO GET TO WORK BECAUSE OF THE INVESTIGATIONS
cv-valid-test/sample-001724.mp3,I MYSELF HEARD NOTHING OF THAT
cv-valid-test/sample-001725.mp3,THE BOY BEGAN TO DIG INTO THE TUNE
cv-valid-test/sample-001726.mp3,NEIGHBORS MOVED AWAY AND THERE REMAINED ONLY A FEW SMALL SHOPS ON THE HILL

cv-valid-test/sample-001729.mp3,TO DO THAT SUCCESSFULLY I MUST HAVE NO FEAR OF FAILURE
cv-valid-test/sample-001730.mp3,I THOUGHT ABOUT WHETHER WE SHOULD FIND COINS AND MODELS IN IT AND SO ON
cv-valid-test/sample-001731.mp3,BUT HE KEPT QUIET BECAUSE HE HAD HEARD WHAT THE ALCHEMIST SAID TO THE MONK
cv-valid-test/sample-001732.mp3,DON'T SHARE YOUR OPINIONS SO READILY BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW WHO IS LISTENING
cv-valid-test/sample-001733.mp3,SO YOU GOT MARRIED

cv-valid-test/sample-001735.mp3,YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S HAPPENED TO ME
cv-valid-test/sample-001736.mp3,IN THOSE DAYS VERY FEW OF THE PEOPLE HAD ANY IDEA ABOUT ASTRONOMY

cv-valid-test/sample-002004.mp3,ENOUGH SAID THE BOY
cv-valid-test/sample-002005.mp3,HE DID FIND IT SOON AFTER DAWN AND NOT FAR FROM THE SAND PITS
cv-valid-test/sample-002006.mp3,HE PREPARED HIMSELF A SANDWICH HAND DRANK SOME HOT TEA FROM A CRYSTAL GLASS
cv-valid-test/sample-002007.mp3,THERE WAS HARDLY ANY MOVEMENT FROM THE PIT

cv-valid-test/sample-002012.mp3,THE BOY HAD NOTICED THAT THE ENGLISHMAN WAS IRRITABLE AND MISSED HIS BOOKS
cv-valid-test/sample-002013.mp3,I WAS DISAPPOINTED AT THIS INANIMATE BOUTH
cv-valid-test/sample-002014.mp3,THEY MIGHT EVEN HAVE BECOME FRIENDS BUT THE ENGLISHMAN CLOSED OFF THE CONVERSATION
cv-valid-test/sample-002015.mp3,HOW MUCH DO YOU MAKE WEAK
cv-valid-test/sample-002016.mp3,I'LL GIVE IT A DRINK
cv-valid-test/sample-002017.mp3,I THINK THEY PERCEIVED THAT NOTHING WAS TO BE DONE U
cv-valid-test/sample-002018.mp3,IT LEFT A GREENISH STREAK THAT GLOWED FOR SOME SECONDS
cv-valid-test/sample-002019.mp3,MAYBE THESE DESERT BIRDS COULD EXPLAIN TO HIM THE MEANING OF LOVE WITHOUT OWNERSHIP

cv-valid-test/sample-002043.mp3,THAT GIVES YOU AN IDEA OF WHAT I'M UP AGAINST
cv-valid-test/sample-002044.mp3,THEY WERE BOTH SILENT FOR A TIME OBSERVING THE PLAZA AND THE TOWNSPEOPLE
cv-valid-test/sample-002045.mp3,WHEN YOU PLAY CARDS THE FIRST TIME YOU ARE ALMOST SURE TO WIN

cv-valid-test/sample-002103.mp3,I DIDN'T EVEN ASK HIM
cv-valid-test/sample-002104.mp3,THE BOY WAS ASTRONIZED BY WHAT HE SAW INSIDE
cv-valid-test/sample-002105.mp3,HE WAS SURE THE GIRL WOULD NEVER UNDERSTAND
cv-valid-test/sample-002106.mp3,BUT HE DECIDED FIRST TO BUYD HIS BACKARY AND PUT SOME MONEY ASIDE
cv-valid-test/sample-002107.mp3,IT'S A GOOD THING I GOT HERE IN TIME
cv-valid-test/sample-002108.mp3,AS SOON AS HE SAW ME AMONG THE CROWD HE CALLED TO ME TO COME DOWN
cv-valid-test/sample-002109.mp3,IT WOULD HAVE BEEN VISIBLE TO ME HAD I ENLENGED OFF AS A POSSED
cv-valid-test/sample-002110.mp3,SHE COULDN'T FIND A WASTEBASKET
cv-valid-test/sample-002111.mp3,SUDDENLY FOR NO APPARENT REASON THE BOY'S HORSE BEGAN TO SLOW
cv-valid-test/sample-002112.mp3,THEY WERE ALWAYS JUST SOMEBODY TO FILL UP THE BLEACHERS

cv-valid-test/sample-002121.mp3,MOST OF THEM WERE STARING QUIETLY AT THE BIG TABLE
cv-valid-test/sample-002122.mp3,THE ENGLISHMAN HAD SEVERAL SUIT CASES FILLED WITH BOOKS
cv-valid-test/sample-002123.mp3,YOU'RE JUST THE ONE I WANTED TO SEE
cv-valid-test/sample-002124.mp3,THEY WERE FASCINATING STORIES EACH OF THEM LIVED OUT HIS DESTINY TO THE END
cv-valid-test/sample-002125.mp3,THAT'S WHY BIRDS ISY HERE
cv-valid-test/sample-002126.mp3,A LARGE PIECE SUDDENLY CAME OFF AND FELL WITH A LOUD AND SHARP NOISE

cv-valid-test/sample-002139.mp3,THE INTERNET OF UNCONTROLLED THINGS BROUGHT US A DISTRIBUTED DENIAL OF SERVICE ATTACK ONCE AGAIN
cv-valid-test/sample-002140.mp3,AND THE ODOR OF THE ANIMALS BECAME A BIT MORE TOLERABLE
cv-valid-test/sample-002141.mp3,THE BOY REMEMBERED HIS DREAM AND SUDDENLY EVERYTHING WAS CLEAR TO HIM
cv-valid-test/sample-002142.mp3,AND SHOULDN'T THEY BE GARNISHED

cv-valid-test/sample-002168.mp3,YOU HAVE A MANIA FOR SIMPLIFYING EVERYTHING ANSWERED THE ENGLISHMAN IRRITATED
cv-valid-test/sample-002169.mp3,THERE WAS NO WAY FOR EVERYBODY TO KNOW ABOUT ALCHEMY
cv-valid-test/sample-002170.mp3,THE BOY APPROACHED HER TO ASK ABOUT THE ALCHEMIST
cv-valid-test/sample-002171.mp3,NATURE KNOWS ME AS THE WISEST BEING IN CREATION THE SUN SAID
cv-valid-test/sample-002172.mp3,ONE OF US IS GOING TO JAIL
cv-valid-test/sample-002173.mp3,MY WIFE POINTED OUT TO ME THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE RED GREEN AND YELLOW SIGNAL LIGHTS
cv-valid-test/sample-002174.mp3,IT'S A COMMENTARY ON WHAT WE LAUGHINGLY CALL THE CIVILIZED WORLD
cv-valid-test/sample-002175.mp3,IT LEFT A GREENISH STREAK THAT GLOWED FOR SOME SECONDS

cv-valid-test/sample-002179.mp3,A PRACTICE OF INFIDELS HE SAID TO HIMSELF

cv-valid-test/sample-002184.mp3,NEXT MORNING THERE WERE TWO THOUSAND ARMED MEN SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THE PALM TREES AT ALFEGUM
cv-valid-test/sample-002185.mp3,WHY THE SHOTS STOPPED AFTER THE TENTH NO ONE ON EARTH HAS TRIED TO EXPLAIN
cv-valid-test/sample-002186.mp3,THE GUY THOUGHT HE WAS A LUNATIC AT LARGE AND MADE AN UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPT TO STOP HIM
cv-valid-test/sample-002187.mp3,THERE IS A WAY OUT

cv-valid-test/sample-002189.mp3,THE TRIBAL CHIEFTAIN CALLED FOR THE BOY AND PRESENTED HIM WITH FIFTY PIECES OF GOLD
cv-valid-test/sample-002190.mp3,YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE RICH SKINNY POPULAR OR EVEN OWN A CAPE TO PERFORM A RANDOM ACT OF KINDNESS
cv-valid-test/sample-002191.mp3,HE DID FIND IT SOON AFTER DAWN AND NOT FAR FROM THE SAND PITS
cv-valid-test/sample-002192.mp3,HUNDREDS OF OBSERVERS SAW THE FLAME THAT NIGHT AND THE NIGHT AFTER
cv-valid-test/sample-002193.mp3,I'M NEVER MORE AWARE OF OF ROOM'S ACOUSTICS THAN WHEN I'M TRYING TO ENJOY A SNAK HAVE NER INTENTION OF SHARING
cv-valid-test/sample-002194.mp3,THERE'S LIFE HERE THE BOY SAID TO THE ALCHEMIST
cv-valid-test/sample-002195.mp3,I HAVE TO FIND A MAN WHO KNOWS THAT UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE
cv-valid-test/sample-002196.mp3,THE BOY THOUGHT OF FANTIMA
cv-valid-test/sample-002197.mp3,AND THE ALCHEMIST UNDERSTOOD THAT THE BOY'S HEART HAD RETURNED TO THE SOUL OF THE WORLD
cv-valid-test/sample-002198.mp3,THEN SUDDENLY HE NOTICED IT WITH A START
cv-valid-test/sample-002199.mp3,SOMEONE SET FIRE TO THE TRASH
cv-valid-test/sample-002200.mp3,THEY'D NEVER LET YOU GO
cv-valid-test/sample-002201.mp3,IN ONE HE HAD READ THAT MANY YEARS AGO A FAMOUS ARABIAN ALCHEMIST HAD VISITED EUROPE

cv-valid-test/sample-002203.mp3,WHAT A WONDERFUL WEATHER
cv-valid-test/sample-002204.mp3,BEFORE GUNS WERE INVENTED ARMIES HAD TO THROW BULLETS AT EACH OTHER AND IF A BULLET TOUCHED YOU YOU HAD TO SIT OUT UNTIL THE NEXT WAR
cv-valid-test/sample-002205.mp3,I HAVE WATCHED THE CARAVAN AS IT CROSSED THE DESERT HE SAID

cv-valid-test/sample-002215.mp3,THE TWO WALKED OUT AMONG THE PALMS
cv-valid-test/sample-002216.mp3,THE GREATEST AUTHORITY ON NETEROIDS STATED THAT THE HEIGHT OF ITS FIRST APPEARANCE WAS ABOUT NINETY OR ONE HUNDRED MILES
cv-valid-test/sample-002217.mp3,AND SO DESPITE THE FACT THAT HE WAS A ROMAN CENSURIAN HE CONVERTED TO THEIR FAITH
cv-valid-test/sample-002218.mp3,MATERELLA IS A CREAMY CHEESE THAT GOES WELL WITH TOMATO AND BASEL
cv-valid-test/sample-002219.mp3,HE'S THE MAN THE ADS ARE WRITTEN FOR

cv-valid-test/sample-002221.mp3,A LINE OF FLAME HIGH CAN BE SEEN IN THE ATMOSPHERE
cv-valid-test/sample-002222.mp3,HE MUST BE DISGUISED TO AVOID ENCOUNTERS WITH THEBES
cv-valid-test/sample-002223.mp3,THE DESERT WAS ALL STANDING SOME STRETCHES AND ROCKING OTHERS
cv-valid-test/sample-002224.mp3,AM I TALKING TOO MUCH
cv-valid-test/sample-002225.mp3,FOR AT THAT TIME IT HAD NOT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT IT MIGHT BE HOLLOW
cv-valid-test/sample-002226.mp3,THE CAMEL DRIVER WAS NOT A FIGHTER AND HE HAD CONSULTED WITH SEERS
cv-valid-test/sample-002227.mp3,I DON'T BLAME THEM
cv-valid-test/sample-002228.mp3,MARY TOLD ME THAT SHE GOT UP TO GOT TO MEET UP WITH YOU WHILE SHE WAS BACK IN SAN FRANCISCO
cv-valid-test/sample-002229.mp3,AT THAT POINT IN THEIR LINES EVERYTHING IS CLEAR AND EVERYTHING IS POSSIBLE
cv-valid-test/sample-002230.mp3,APOLOGIES FOR NOT CALLING YOU BACK
cv-valid-test/sample-002231.mp3,IT TOOK HIM AWHILE TO GET TO THE OFFICE
cv-valid-test/sample-002232.mp3,THE SWAT ENTRYTENE USED AN OPTICAL LAUNT TO OBSERVE THE PROCEEDINGS BEHIND THE DOOR
cv-valid-test/sample-002233.mp3,NO DOUBT THE IMPACT HAD CAUSED A FLASH OF FIRE
cv-valid-test/sample-002234.mp3,I JUST KNOW THAT THE TRADITION IS ALWAYS RIGHT
cv-valid-test/sample-002235.mp3,THAT BAKER HE SAID TO HIMSELF WITHOUT COMPLETING THE THOUGHT
cv-valid-test/sample-002236.mp3,BUT THE KING OF SALEM HOPED DESPERATELY THAT THE BOY WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL
cv-valid-test/sample-002237.mp3,HE CALLED TO THE BOY AND THEY TOOK A WALK ALONG THE DUNES SURROUNDING THE ENCAMPMENT

cv-valid-test/sample-002486.mp3,THEN HE DROPPED HIS SPADE PICKED UP HIS JACKET AND CAME OUT INTO THE ROAD
cv-valid-test/sample-002487.mp3,THE TURF AND GREVEL AROUND IT SEEMED CHARRED AS IF BY A SUDDEN EXPLOSION
cv-valid-test/sample-002488.mp3,SOME STORMS ARE WORTH THE WRECKAGE
cv-valid-test/sample-002489.mp3,JUST FOR THE FIRST YEAR
cv-valid-test/sample-002490.mp3,AS THEY MOVED ALONG THE BOY TRIED TO LISTEN TO HIS HEART
cv-valid-test/sample-002491.mp3,THE HEATHER WAS ON FIRE AND YOU COULD SEE A THIN BLUE SMOKE RISING UP SLOWLY
cv-valid-test/sample-002492.mp3,AND DON'T BUMP IT TO ANYTHING
cv-valid-test/sample-002493.mp3,THE NEARBY CITY OF SUTA HAD GROWN FASTER THAN KANGIA AND BUSINESS HAD FALLEN OFF
cv-valid-test/sample-002494.mp3,FEW PEOPLE REALIZE THE IMMENSITY OF VACANCY
cv-valid-test/sample-002495.mp3,THE OLD WOMAN HAD SAID THE SAME THING
cv-valid-test/sample-002496.mp3,I SAID I WISH I'D NEVER BEEN BORN
cv-valid-test/sample-002497.mp3,I GAVE YOU FIFTY JUST THE OTHER DAY
cv-valid-test/sample-002498.mp3,WHERE IS THE TREASURE HE ASKED
cv-valid-test/sample-002499.mp3,HE PREFERRED TO SIT DOWN AND WAIT
cv-valid-test/sample-002500.mp3,IT WAS THE LEVANTA THE WIND THAT CAME FROM AFRICA
cv-valid-test/sample-002501.mp3,I THOUGHT ABOUT THE DIFFICULTIES IN TRANSLATION THAT MIGHT ARISE
cv-valid-test/sample-002502.mp3,HAPPY NEW YEAR TO YOU ALL
cv-valid-test/sample-002503.mp3,AND THE MURMUR LASTED LONGER THAN A SIMPLE VOW WOULD HAVE
cv-valid-test/sample-002504.mp3,THIS IS JOHN DAVIS
cv-valid-test/sample-002505.mp3,THE BOY AWOKE AS THE SUN ROSE
cv-valid-test/sample-002506.mp3,THREE CHEERS FOR ADIN CHRISTOPHER
cv-valid-test/sample-002507.mp3,BUT NONE OF THAT MATTERED TO THE ALCHEMIST
cv-valid-test/sample-002508.mp3,TOMORROW IS ANOTHER DAY
cv-valid-test/sample-002509.mp3,I JUST DON'T TRUST ANYONE WHO SAYS THEY'VE NEVER HAD HAMBURG OR HELPER
cv-valid-test/sample-002510.mp3,ONCE AGAIN HE WAS EXPERIENCYING THE LANGUAGE WITHOUTWORDS
cv-valid-test/sample-002511.mp3,IN THOSE DAYS VERY FEW OF THE PEOPLE HAD ANY IDEA ABOUT ASTRALAMUMMY
cv-valid-test/sample-002512.mp3,A RESEARCH BEGINS WITH BEGINNES LUCKS
cv-valid-test/sample-002513.mp3,THE BOY SAW A MAN APPEAR BEHIND THE COUNTER
cv-valid-test/sample-002514.mp3,BUT THE BOY NEVER TOOK HIS EYE OFF HIS NEW FRIEND
cv-valid-test/sample-002515.mp3,I'M AFRAID THAT IF MY DREAM IS REALIZED I'LL HAVE NO REASON TO GO ON LIVING
cv-valid-test/sample-002516.mp3,HOW DO I GUESS AT THE FUTURE
cv-valid-test/sample-002517.mp3,YET EACH FELT HIS HEART BEAT A BIT FAST
cv-valid-test/sample-002518.mp3,LISTEN TO YOUR HEART
cv-valid-test/sample-002519.mp3,WE WERE ALL MADE BY THE SAME HAND AND WE HAVE THE SAME SOUL
cv-valid-test/sample-002520.mp3,THE BOY WANTED TO BELIEVE THAT HIS FRIEND HAD SIMPLY BECOME SEPARATED FROM HIM BY ACCIDENT
cv-valid-test/sample-002521.mp3,CHRISTMAS EVE AT MIDNIGHT
cv-valid-test/sample-002522.mp3,FIRST YOU GOT TO SIGN A RECEIPT
cv-valid-test/sample-002523.mp3,IT MADE ME VERY DEPRESSED
cv-valid-test/sample-002524.mp3,THE OCTOPUST WORRIED THE SQUID
cv-valid-test/sample-002525.mp3,THE BOY TRIED TO READ WHAT WAS WRITTEN IN THE SAND
cv-valid-test/sample-002526.mp3,THE BOY'S GOING TO END SOME DAY THE GIRL SAID
cv-valid-test/sample-002527.mp3,I TOLD YOU THAT YOUR DREAM WAS A DIFFICULT ONE
cv-valid-test/sample-002528.mp3,THEY MOUNTED THEIR HORSES AND RODE OUT IN THE DIRECTION OF THE PYRAMIDS OF EGYPT
cv-valid-test/sample-002529.mp3,YOU WANT TO TAKE THIS OUTSIDE
cv-valid-test/sample-002530.mp3,WE MUST BE GOOD
cv-valid-test/sample-002531.mp3,THINK I'D BETTER BE GOING
cv-valid-test/sample-002532.mp3,HAVE TRUSTED MORE IN YOUR LOVE FOR A FATIMA
cv-valid-test/sample-002533.mp3,THEN SUDDENLY HE NOTICED IT WITH A STOT
cv-valid-test/sample-002534.mp3,HE DECIDED TO RETURN TO HIS FRIENDS STARTLED BY THE LONGEST TRUE POSPO
cv-valid-test/sample-002535.mp3,HE COULD ALWAYS BECOME A CRYSTAL SALESMAN AGAIN
cv-valid-test/sample-002536.mp3,I THINK THEY PERCEIVED THAT NOTHING WAS TO BE DONE AT THE MOMENT
cv-valid-test/sample-002537.mp3,YOU'LL MARRY FATIMIR AND YOU'LL BOTH BE HAPPY FOR A YEAR
cv-valid-test/sample-002538.mp3,I GUESS I'M NOT QUITE THE FOOTBALL TYPE
cv-valid-test/sample-002539.mp3,HE HAD SUDDENLY REMEMBERED THAT IN TARIFA THERE WAS AN OLD WOMAN WHO INTERPRETED DREAMS
cv-valid-test/sample-002540.mp3,IT SEEMED SUCH A LITTLE THING SO BRIGHT AND SMALL AND STILL
cv-valid-test/sample-002541.mp3,IT SEEMED LIKE SUCH A LITTLE THING SO BRIGHT AND SMALL AND STILL
cv-valid-test/sample-002542.mp3,THE OCTAPUST WORRIED THE SQUIT
cv-valid-test/sample-002543.mp3,WHEN HE SAW HENDERSON IN HIS GARDEN HE CALLED OVER THE FENCE AND MADE HIMSELF UNDERSTOOD
cv-valid-test/sample-002544.mp3,AND HE GAVE THE BOY HIS BLESSING
cv-valid-test/sample-002545.mp3,SHE FINDS THE WORLD HAS FEET OF CLAY
cv-valid-test/sample-002546.mp3,IT WAS ONLY WHEN I GOT THIS CLOSE TO IT THAT THE STRANGENESS OF IT WAS AT ALL EVIDENT TO ME
cv-valid-test/sample-002547.mp3,A PART OF ME IS ALSO TRYING TO COME TO TERMS WITH THE FACT THAT I WON'T BE ABLE TO TRAVEL AS MUCH ANYMORE
cv-valid-test/sample-002548.mp3,I WAITED ALL AFTERNOON AND EVENING HE SAID
cv-valid-test/sample-002549.mp3,CARBON AND MON OXIDE IS A VERY DANGEROUS GAS
cv-valid-test/sample-002550.mp3,I NEVER SAID I'D TAKE IT
cv-valid-test/sample-002551.mp3,HIS TEA SHIRT WAS DRENCHED IN SWEAT
cv-valid-test/sample-002552.mp3,ONLY CHRESS COULDN'T WAIT QUITE AS LONG AS THE OTHERS
cv-valid-test/sample-002553.mp3,HOW DOES ANYTHING LIKE THIS EVER START
cv-valid-test/sample-002554.mp3,WHEN YOU PLAY CARDS THE FIRST TIME YOU'RE ALMOST SURE TO WIN
cv-valid-test/sample-002555.mp3,A HUGE HOLE HAD BEEN MADE BY THE IMPACT OF THE PROJECTILE
cv-valid-test/sample-002556.mp3,THE WOMAN WAS SILENT FOR SOME TIME
cv-valid-test/sample-002557.mp3,HE CAME TO UNDERSTAND ITS DODGES AND TRICKS AND TO ACCEPT IT AS IT WAS
cv-valid-test/sample-002558.mp3,AND IN THAT MOOD HE WAS GRATEFUL TO BE IN LOVE
cv-valid-test/sample-002559.mp3,TWO DAYS LATER THE MERCHANT SPOKE TO THE BOY ABOUT THE DISPLAY
cv-valid-test/sample-002560.mp3,AND HE BROUGHT SEX SHEEP WITH HIM
cv-valid-test/sample-002561.mp3,NOW I'M PICKING ING VIAPURAP STARTED TEN YEARS AGO
cv-valid-test/sample-002562.mp3,IT HELPED ME TO TRUST IN PUTIL THE ENGLISHMAN ANSWERED

cv-valid-test/sample-002564.mp3,YOU KNEW THE WHOLE STORY
cv-valid-test/sample-002565.mp3,IF YOU CAN CONCENTRATE ALWAYS ON THE PRESENT HE'LL BE A HAPPY MAN
cv-valid-test/sample-002566.mp3,HE'LL BE READY ON TIME
cv-valid-test/sample-002567.mp3,HOW THEY MANAGE TO IMPROVISE AT SUCH SHORT NOTICE SHE'LL NEVER KNOW
cv-valid-test/sample-002568.mp3,WHEN AFTERNOON THEY PASSED BY THE ENCAMPMENT OF ONE OF THE TRIBES
cv-valid-test/sample-002569.mp3,THERE'S NOBODY ELSE ON THE PAPER WHO CAN WRITE
cv-valid-test/sample-002570.mp3,HUNDREDS MUST HAVE SEEN IT AND TAKEN IT FOR A FALLING STAR
cv-valid-test/sample-002571.mp3,EVERYTHING HAS BEEN WRITTEN BY THE SAME HAND
cv-valid-test/sample-002572.mp3,YOU'RE RIGHT WHEN YOU SAY MY FATHER WAS NO BUSINESS MAN
cv-valid-test/sample-002573.mp3,THE BOY SPENT A SLEEPLESS NIGHT
cv-valid-test/sample-002574.mp3,THE MONEY IS UNIMPORTANT
cv-valid-test/sample-002575.mp3,BUT ONLY SPEAK A WORD AND MY SERVANT WILL BE HEALED
cv-valid-test/sample-002576.mp3,ONE IS LOVED BECAUSE ONE IS LOVED
cv-valid-test/sample-002577.mp3,THERE WAS VERY LITTLE TALKING
cv-valid-test/sample-002578.mp3,NOT ONLY DID HE MANAGE TO DO IT HE DID IT PROFESSIONALLY
cv-valid-test/sample-002579.mp3,THE TWO MEN HURRIED BACK AND FOUND THE CYLINDER STILL LYING IN THE SAME POSITION
cv-valid-test/sample-002580.mp3,HALF AN HOUR LATER HIS SHOVEL HIT SOMETHING SOLID
cv-valid-test/sample-002581.mp3,I HAD THE EVERYONE HER SCARRY BARSY'S TEETH DREAMED AGAIN
cv-valid-test/sample-002582.mp3,AS THEY WATCHED THEIR WAVES CRASHING INTO EACH OTHER ALICE THOUGHT OF WHOM
cv-valid-test/sample-002583.mp3,NOW LEAVE US ALONE SAID THE BOY TOOK A YOUNG ARAB
cv-valid-test/sample-002584.mp3,NONE OF WHAT THE OLD MAN WAS SAYING MADE MUCH SENSE TO THE BOY
cv-valid-test/sample-002585.mp3,TWO YEARS AGO RIGHT HERE ON THIS SPOT I HAD A RECURRENT DREAM TOO
cv-valid-test/sample-002586.mp3,YOU WOULD MIND LIVING IN THE NITR'S HOUSE IN TOWN
cv-valid-test/sample-002587.mp3,WELL USUALLY I LEARN MORE FROM MY SHEEP THAN FROM BOOKS HE ANSWERED
cv-valid-test/sample-002588.mp3,CAN I HELP YOU ASKED THE MAN BEHIND THE WINDOW
cv-valid-test/sample-002589.mp3,I'M GOING INTO BUSINESS FOR MYSELF
cv-valid-test/sample-002590.mp3,THE STRANGER SEEMED SATISFIED WITH THE ANSWER
cv-valid-test/sample-002591.mp3,YOU SHOULD SEE THE OTHER GUY SPECIFICALLY HOW GOOD AT FIGHTING HE IS
cv-valid-test/sample-002592.mp3,ONE CAN IMAGINE THESE TWO COVERED WITH SAND RUNNING UP THE LITTLE STREET IN THE BRIGHT SUNLIGHT
cv-valid-test/sample-002593.mp3,THEY'RE HAVING HAMBUTHERS
cv-valid-test/sample-002594.mp3,IT WAS SPREAYED IN RED WITH YELLOW EDGES
cv-valid-test/sample-002595.mp3,THE AUTHORS CLAIM TO SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS VARIATIONS DUE TO GEOMETRIC TRANSFORMATIONS IN THE ACQUIRED IMAGES
cv-valid-test/sample-002596.mp3,THE TARS AND GRAVEL AROUND IT SEEMED TO BE SHARED AS IF BY A SUDDEN EXPLOSION
cv-valid-test/sample-002597.mp3,HENDERSON WAS TAKING IT IN
cv-valid-test/sample-002598.mp3,HE DIDN'T WANT TO CRY WITH THE OTHER PEOPLE THERE
cv-valid-test/sample-002599.mp3,LOOKING THROUGH THE TELESCOPE I SAW A CIRCLE OF DEEP BLUE AND THE LITTLE ROUND PLANET
cv-valid-test/sample-002600.mp3,BE CAREFUL WITH YOUR PROGNOSTICATIONS SAID THE STRANGER
cv-valid-test/sample-002601.mp3,YOU'RE ALWAYS AT THE END OF YOUR JOURNEY SAID THE ALCHEMIST
cv-valid-test/sample-002602.mp3,AIR WAS EITHER ENTERING OR ESCAPING AT THE RIM WITH A THIN SIZZLING SOUND
cv-valid-test/sample-002603.mp3,JUST ONE MORE THING
cv-valid-test/sample-002604.mp3,THE TOP HAD CERTAINLY CEASED TO ROTATE
cv-valid-test/sample-002605.mp3,BUT ONE OF THEM SEIZED THE BOY AND YANXED HIM BACK OUT OF THE HOLE
cv-valid-test/sample-002606.mp3,THEY'D NEVER LET YOU GO
cv-valid-test/sample-002607.mp3,YOU DOMINATED THOSE HORSEMEN WITH THE WAY YOU LOOKED AT THEM HE SAID
cv-valid-test/sample-002608.mp3,YOU'VE PLAYED IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN
cv-valid-test/sample-002609.mp3,FOR THAT IMET HAD NOT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT IT MIGHT BE HOLLOW
cv-valid-test/sample-002610.mp3,THE BOY WENT TO THE WORLD EVERY DAY TO MEET WITH RATIMA
cv-valid-test/sample-002611.mp3,WELL THEN WHY DID YOU LET ME DO IT THE BOY ASKED
cv-valid-test/sample-002612.mp3,OF COURSE YOU WOULDN'T KNOW
cv-valid-test/sample-002613.mp3,THE BOY REPEATED HIS QUESTION
cv-valid-test/sample-002614.mp3,HE ROSE AND MADE HIS WAY BACK TOWARD THE PALM TREES
cv-valid-test/sample-002615.mp3,TELL HER I ELECTED HER AND I CAN HAVE HER IMPEACHED
cv-valid-test/sample-002616.mp3,OR A MAN INTO THE WIND
cv-valid-test/sample-002617.mp3,IT IS CALLED THE PRINCIPLE OF FAVORABILITY
cv-valid-test/sample-002618.mp3,THE ALCHEMIST'S WORDS ECHOED OUT LIKE A CURSE
cv-valid-test/sample-002619.mp3,EVERYTHING HAD BEEN WRITTEN BY THE SAME HAND
cv-valid-test/sample-002620.mp3,STOP TREATING ME LIKE A CHILD
cv-valid-test/sample-002621.mp3,EVERY TIME HE SAW HER HE FELT NERVOUS
cv-valid-test/sample-002622.mp3,AND IT'S NOT LOVE TO SEE EVERYTHING FROM A DISTANCE LIKE YOU DO
cv-valid-test/sample-002623.mp3,HE WAS TWENTY MINUTES FROM HIS TENT AND BEGAN TO MAKE HIS WAY THERE
cv-valid-test/sample-002624.mp3,YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO
cv-valid-test/sample-002625.mp3,IT REALLY OUGHT TO BE EASY EXCEPT THAT RIGHT NOW THERE'S AN ELTH STANDING BUCG
cv-valid-test/sample-002626.mp3,TEACHING GOODS ENGLISH WITH COMMONWAYSE IS A WINWID SITUATION
cv-valid-test/sample-002627.mp3,IT WAS MORE ACTIVITY THAN USUAL FOR THIS TIME OF THE MORNING
cv-valid-test/sample-002628.mp3,I HAVE KNOWN TRUE ALCHEMISTS THE ALCHEMIST CONTINUED
cv-valid-test/sample-002629.mp3,THE TERM JUST MY TWO CENTS IS ABOUT OPINION NOT ABOUT MONEY
cv-valid-test/sample-002630.mp3,CAN I GET A WOOPWOO
cv-valid-test/sample-002631.mp3,AND IT'S NOT LOVE TO SEE EVERYTHING FROM A DISTANCE LIKE YOU DO
cv-valid-test/sample-002632.mp3,CROADSHOT OF THE COLUMNI
cv-valid-test/sample-002633.mp3,HE DIDN'T WANT TO CRY WITH THE OTHER PEOPLE THERE
cv-valid-test/sample-002634.mp3,HE COULD SEE THAT THE OLD MAN WANTED TO KNOW MORE ABOUT HIS LIFE
cv-valid-test/sample-002635.mp3,HIS WAY ISN'T THE SAME AS MINE NOR MINESSES
cv-valid-test/sample-002636.mp3,THEY MIGHT EVEN HAVE BECOME FRIENDS BUT THE ENGLISHMAN CLOSED OFF THE CONVERSATION
cv-valid-test/sample-002637.mp3,I HEARD WHAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT THE OTHER DAY WITH THE ALCHEMIST THE WIND SAID
cv-valid-test/sample-002638.mp3,MAYBE THAT'S WHY THEY CAME
cv-valid-test/sample-002639.mp3,THE BOY THOUGHT ABOUT THE CRYSTAL MERCHANT
cv-valid-test/sample-002640.mp3,I DON'T WANT ANYTHING ELSE IN LIFE
cv-valid-test/sample-002641.mp3,DEE'S HOUSE RIGHT NOW
cv-valid-test/sample-002642.mp3,EARLIER THIS YEAR WE FIND A REALLY NICE PLACE NEAR MY OFFICE AND WE MOVED IN TOGETHER
cv-valid-test/sample-002643.mp3,BUT THE ALCHEMIST CONTINUED TO LOOK TO THE HORIZON
cv-valid-test/sample-002644.mp3,IS THERE NO SENSE OF HONOR LEFT IN HIS COUNTRY
cv-valid-test/sample-002645.mp3,SOMETIMES THERE'S JUST NO WAY TO HOLD BACK THE REVER
cv-valid-test/sample-002646.mp3,BUT I FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO GET TO WORK BECAUSE OF THEIR INVESTIGATIONS
cv-valid-test/sample-002647.mp3,HE WAS ALARMED BY WHAT HAD HAPPENED
cv-valid-test/sample-002648.mp3,BUT WE'VE ALL GOT TO GET IN THERE AND PLAY
cv-valid-test/sample-002649.mp3,THERE MIGHT BE SECRET MESSAGES IN THIS TEXT
cv-valid-test/sample-002650.mp3,I FIND THAT THE BEST WAY TO COMPACT THIS ISSUE IS TO USE THE BUSD IN THE CABULARY ETECTA
cv-valid-test/sample-002651.mp3,HE WATCHED THE HAWKS AS THEY DRIFTED ON THE WIND
cv-valid-test/sample-002652.mp3,SOME OF OUR BIGGEST CLIENTS ARE AFFECTED
cv-valid-test/sample-002653.mp3,THEN HE TOOK FROM HIS KNAPSACK A BOTTLE OF WINE AND DRANK SOME
cv-valid-test/sample-002654.mp3,I'M LEAVING TODAY SAID THE BOY
cv-valid-test/sample-002655.mp3,SAY SOMETHING ELSE
cv-valid-test/sample-002656.mp3,BECAUSE THE CRYSTAL WAS DIRTY
cv-valid-test/sample-002657.mp3,IT WAS AS IF IT QUIVERED BUT REALLY THIS WAS FOR THE TELESCOPE VIBRATING
cv-valid-test/sample-002658.mp3,HE WAS TWENTY MINUTES FROM HIS TAND AND BEGAN TO MAKE HIS WAY THERE
cv-valid-test/sample-002659.mp3,I CAN ALWAYS GO BACK TO BEING A SHEPHERD THE BOY THOUGHT
cv-valid-test/sample-002660.mp3,THE WOMEN TOOK TURNS BUILDING A TALL STABLE PILE OF ROCKS
cv-valid-test/sample-002661.mp3,THEN WHOSE IS IT
cv-valid-test/sample-002662.mp3,MAYBE BECAUSE THAT WASN'T REALLY HIS DREAM
cv-valid-test/sample-002663.mp3,BUT I NEVER SAID ANYTHING LIKE THAT
cv-valid-test/sample-002664.mp3,THE INVADERS CARRIED THE NAME EVERYWHERETHE BEAUTIFUL GIRL SPOKE AN THE INVADERS WITH PRIDE
cv-valid-test/sample-002665.mp3,BECAUSE YOU HAVE ALREADY LOST YOUR SAVINGS TWICE
cv-valid-test/sample-002666.mp3,I WENT STRETCHING MY LEGS CLOSELY AND FEELING MY WAY IN THE DARKS
cv-valid-test/sample-002667.mp3,CAME TO THE BAR HE HAD ENTERED ON HIS FIRST DAY THERE
cv-valid-test/sample-002668.mp3,AND HE LOOKED OUT OVER THE DESERT THAT HAD BROUGHT HIM TO THE WOMAN HE LOVED
cv-valid-test/sample-002669.mp3,EVERYONE SEEMED VERY EXCITED
cv-valid-test/sample-002670.mp3,YOU'VE NUCA
cv-valid-test/sample-002671.mp3,WE COULDN'T MAKE IT IN A WEEK
cv-valid-test/sample-002672.mp3,THE FIVE FRENCH TORIES STEPPED OVER THE EXCITED OL DOGS
cv-valid-test/sample-002673.mp3,YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE LEFT
cv-valid-test/sample-002674.mp3,HAVING HEARD THAT THE BOY BECAME EVEN MORE INTERESTED NOW TO ME
cv-valid-test/sample-002675.mp3,THE STREAMER OF GAS CAME DOWN TOWERED SOSS
cv-valid-test/sample-002676.mp3,BUT LET YOU HEAR WHAT I FEEL
cv-valid-test/sample-002677.mp3,IT HAD A DIAMETER OF ABOUT THIRTY YARDS
cv-valid-test/sample-002678.mp3,THE STREAMER OF GAS CAME OUT TOWARDS US
cv-valid-test/sample-002679.mp3,THERE ARE MANY LANGUAGES SPOKEN BY THINGS THE BOY SAID
cv-valid-test/sample-002680.mp3,THERE WAS A GENERAL MOVEMENT BACKWARDS
cv-valid-test/sample-002681.mp3,I'M GOING TO FIND THAT DAMNED ALCHEMIST THE ENGLISHMAN THOUGHT
cv-valid-test/sample-002682.mp3,THEY SHOUTED CONSOLATION AND PROMISES AND WENT OFF BACK TO THE TOWN AGAIN TO GET HELP
cv-valid-test/sample-002683.mp3,THEY EAT LUNCH TOGETHER OFTEN BUT DON'T REALLY TALK OUTSIDE THE OFFICE
cv-valid-test/sample-002684.mp3,I'VE ALREADY HAD THAT EXPERIENCE WITH MY SHEEP AND NOW IT'S HAPPENING WITH PEOPLE
cv-valid-test/sample-002685.mp3,BUT I'M NOT THROUGH COMPLAINING YET
cv-valid-test/sample-002686.mp3,IT IS STILL A PHENOMENAL MOVEMENT
cv-valid-test/sample-002687.mp3,IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO REMEMBER ALL THE DETAILS THAT HE COVERED IN AN HOUR
cv-valid-test/sample-002688.mp3,THET ANYTHING ELSE IN MY LIFE
cv-valid-test/sample-002689.mp3,THEY WERE FASCINATING STORIES EACH OF THEM LIVED OUT HIS DESTINY TO THE END
cv-valid-test/sample-002690.mp3,I TOLD HIM THAT WAS WHAT I HAD COME HERE TO LEARN
cv-valid-test/sample-002691.mp3,THE BOY NOTICED THAT THE OWNER OF THE BAR STOOD NEARBYR LISTENING ATTENTIVELY TO THEIR CONVERSATION
cv-valid-test/sample-002692.mp3,I HEARD A PECULIAR HUMMING SOUND FROM THE PIT
cv-valid-test/sample-002693.mp3,THE BURNING FIRE HAD BEEN EXTINGUISHED
cv-valid-test/sample-002694.mp3,I HAVE TO SEPARATE OUT THE SULPHUR
cv-valid-test/sample-002695.mp3,HE HAD STUDIED LATIN SPANISH AND THEOLOGY
cv-valid-test/sample-002696.mp3,IT LEFT A GREENISH STREAK THAT GLOWED FOR SOME SECONDS
cv-valid-test/sample-002697.mp3,HE FELL COVECTED DOWN BY CENTURIES OF TIME SINCE THE PYRAMID HAS BEEN BUICKED
cv-valid-test/sample-002698.mp3,I WAS DISAPPOINTED AT THIS INANIMATE BULK
cv-valid-test/sample-002699.mp3,BUT THE MERCHANT UNDERSTOOD WHAT THE BOY HAD SAID
cv-valid-test/sample-002700.mp3,I SUPPOSE THAT'S TRUE IN A WAY
cv-valid-test/sample-002701.mp3,IT'S PAST YOUR BED TIME
cv-valid-test/sample-002702.mp3,YA BERY OF PEOPLE ARE ALREADY FAMILIAR WITH ONE AND ARE THINKING OF SWITCHING TO THE OTHER
cv-valid-test/sample-002703.mp3,HUNDREDS OF OBSERVERS SAW THE FLAYING THAT NIGHT ON THE NIGHT AFTER
cv-valid-test/sample-002704.mp3,WHAT'LL I TELL HIM
cv-valid-test/sample-002705.mp3,I AM AN OLD SUPERSTITIOUS ERAB AND I BELIEVE IN OUR PROVERBS
cv-valid-test/sample-002706.mp3,HE WAS THINKING ABOUT OMENS AND SOMEONE HAD APPEARED
cv-valid-test/sample-002707.mp3,SEVERAL FIGURES APPROACHED HIM
cv-valid-test/sample-002708.mp3,IT WAS DROPPING OFF IN FLAKES AND RUNNING DOWN ON THE SAND
cv-valid-test/sample-002709.mp3,I GUESS I WAS HOMESICK
cv-valid-test/sample-002710.mp3,THEN HE TAUGHT ME SOMETHING OF THE UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE AND THE SOUL OF THE WORLD
cv-valid-test/sample-002711.mp3,HIS HEART WAS HEAVY AND HE HAD BEEN MELANCHOLY SINCE THE PREVIOUS NIGHT
cv-valid-test/sample-002712.mp3,WHAT DAY IS IT
cv-valid-test/sample-002713.mp3,AN ALCHEMIST SAID THE ALCHEMIST
cv-valid-test/sample-002714.mp3,AND FOR WISE MEN GOLD IS THE METAL THAT EVOLVED THE FURZUST
cv-valid-test/sample-002715.mp3,THE BOY WAS GETTING IRRITATED
cv-valid-test/sample-002716.mp3,I AIN'T GONE A SQUAL
cv-valid-test/sample-002717.mp3,AT MOST THEY THOUGHT THAT ANOTHER METUID HAD DESCENDED
cv-valid-test/sample-002718.mp3,IT WAS SEEN EARLY IN THE MORNING RUSHING OVER EASTWARD
cv-valid-test/sample-002719.mp3,I AM PROUD OF YOU HE SAID
cv-valid-test/sample-002720.mp3,WHAT ARE YOU DOING UP HERE THEN
cv-valid-test/sample-002721.mp3,THE ENGLISHMAN DIDN'T ANSWER HIM DIRECTLY
cv-valid-test/sample-002722.mp3,YE I LIKE THAT
cv-valid-test/sample-002723.mp3,THEY SET OFF RUNNING WILDLY INTO THE TREES
cv-valid-test/sample-002724.mp3,THE WIND BEGAN TO BLOW AGAIN
cv-valid-test/sample-002725.mp3,THEY WENT ITO THE KITCHEN AT THE BACK OF THE MONASTERY
cv-valid-test/sample-002726.mp3,THE INSURGENTS GATHERED STICKS IN WOOD
cv-valid-test/sample-002727.mp3,SUDDENLY FOR NO APPARENT REASON THE BOY'S HORSE BEGAN TO SLOW
cv-valid-test/sample-002728.mp3,ONE AFTERNOON ONE OF HIS SERVANTS FELL ILL AND IT APPEARED THAT HE WOULD DIE
cv-valid-test/sample-002729.mp3,HIS FATHER SAID NO MORE
cv-valid-test/sample-002730.mp3,FIRST THEY TRIED TO FIND HIM ON THEIR OWN
cv-valid-test/sample-002731.mp3,HO MORGAGES IN AREAS
cv-valid-test/sample-002732.mp3,HIS INTERNITE CONNECTION WAS TOO SLOW
cv-valid-test/sample-002733.mp3,THE BOY WAS SAD AS HE LEFT HER THAT DAY

cv-valid-test/sample-002801.mp3,BUT BEFORE I GO I WANT TO TELL YOU A LITTLE STORY
cv-valid-test/sample-002802.mp3,THE ONLY SHADOW WAS THAT OF A FEW SCATTERED PINE TREES
cv-valid-test/sample-002803.mp3,ONCE TO THE THIEF AND ONCE TO THE GENERAL
cv-valid-test/sample-002804.mp3,AT MOST THEY THOUGHT THAT ANOTHER METEORITE HAD DESCENDED
cv-valid-test/sample-002805.mp3,IT SEEMED SUCH A LITTLE THING SO BRIGHT AND SMALL AND STILL
cv-valid-test/sample-002806.mp3,IT HAD A DIAMETER OF ABOUT THIRTY YARDS
cv-valid-test/sample-002807.mp3,THERE WAS NO EXCUSE FOR GOODMAN TO FLY OFF THE HANDLE
cv-valid-test/sample-002808.mp3,I'M INTERESTED ONLY IN THE PRESENT
cv-valid-test/sample-002809.mp3,AT NIGHT THEY SPREAD THEIR SLEEPING GEAR AND KEPT THEIR FIRES HIDDEN

cv-valid-test/sample-002832.mp3,THE BOY THOUGHT IT A STRANGE QUESTION
cv-valid-test/sample-002833.mp3,THEN HE DROPPED HIS SPADE PICKED UP HIS JACKET AND CAME OUT INTO THE ROAD
cv-valid-test/sample-002834.mp3,YOU GOT YOUR WATER MELIM
cv-valid-test/sample-002835.mp3,MISTER CHRISTAN HAS SOMETHING TO SAY TOUS
cv-valid-test/sample-002836.mp3,I LOST MY WALLET
cv-valid-test/sample-002837.mp3,WHEN I RETURNED TO THE COMMON THE SUN WAS SETTING
cv-valid-test/sample-002838.mp3,I REMEMBER HOW I SAT ON THE TABLE THERE IN THE BLACKNESS WITH PATCHES OF GREEN AND CRIMSON SWIMMING BEFORE MY EYES
cv-valid-test/sample-002839.mp3,AND IN THAT MOOD HE WAS GRATEFUL TO BE IN LOVE
cv-valid-test/sample-002840.mp3,HE TRANSFORMED HIMSELF INTO A STONE THAT ROLLED UP TO THE MINER'S FOOT
cv-valid-test/sample-002841.mp3,AND ALSO BY UNHAPPINESS ENVY AND JEALOUSY
cv-valid-test/sample-002842.mp3,THEY WALKED TOGETHER THROUGH THE NARROW STREETS OF TANGIER
cv-valid-test/sample-002843.mp3,THERE WAS A GENERAL MOVEMENT BACKWARDS
cv-valid-test/sample-002844.mp3,WHEN I TRIED IT ABOUT A YEAR AGO IT DIDN'T WORK NEARLY AS WELL AS USING IT ON MY LOCAL MACHINE
cv-valid-test/sample-002845.mp3,BUT THE EMERALD'S TABLET IS A DIRECT PASSAGE TO THE SALT OF THE WORD
cv-valid-test/sample-002846.mp3,HE WAS SHAKEN INTO WAKEFULNESS BY SOMEONE
cv-valid-test/sample-002847.mp3,HE CARRIED TWO DEAD HAWKS OVER HIS SHOULDER
cv-valid-test/sample-002848.mp3,AS THEY MOVED ALONG THE BOY TRIED TO LISTEN TO HIS HEART
cv-valid-test/sample-002849.mp3,WHEN HE SAW HENDERSON IN HIS GARDEN HE CALLED OVER THE FENCE AND MADE HIMSELF UNDERSTOOD
cv-valid-test/sample-002850.mp3,WHENEVER HE SAW THE SEA OR A FIRE HE FELL SILENT IMPRESSED BY THEIR ELEMENTAL FORCE
cv-valid-test/sample-002851.mp3,THERE WAS SURELY A BAKER IN HAR TOWN
cv-valid-test/sample-002852.mp3,SHE HAD HER CARDIGAN ON
cv-valid-test/sample-002853.mp3,THIS WAS THE STRANGEST OF ALL THINGS THAT EVER CAME TO EARTH FROM OUTER SPACE
cv-valid-test/sample-002854.mp3,SEEN THESE OTHER PEOPLE IN
cv-valid-test/sample-002855.mp3,I FOUND THE LITTLE GRACK CROWD OF ABOUT TWENTY PEOPLE SURROUNDING THE HUGE HOLE
cv-valid-test/sample-002856.mp3,THE BOY AND THE ENGLISHMAN HAD BROUGHT CAMELS AND CLAMPED UNCERTAINLY ONTO THEIR BACKS
cv-valid-test/sample-002857.mp3,WHAT HAVE YOU GOT TO REPORT

cv-valid-test/sample-002862.mp3,THE LEVANTER INCREASED IN INTENSITY
cv-valid-test/sample-002863.mp3,MANY PEOPLE IN BERKSHIRE SURREY AND MIDDLESEX MUST HAVE SEEN IT
cv-valid-test/sample-002864.mp3,YOU CAME SO THAT YOU COULD LEARN ABOUT YOUR DREAMS SAID THE OLD WOMAN
cv-valid-test/sample-002865.mp3,HE DIDN'T WANT HIS HAND TO BEGIN TREMBLING SHOWING THE OLD WOMAN THAT HE WAS FEARFUL
cv-valid-test/sample-002866.mp3,I THOUGHT ABOUT WHETHER WE SHOULD FIND COINS AND MODELS IN IT AND SO ON
cv-valid-test/sample-002867.mp3,THE OLD MAN WAS PROBABLY A GYPSY TOO
cv-valid-test/sample-002868.mp3,THAT ISN'T WHYT I GOT MARRIED FOR
cv-valid-test/sample-002869.mp3,AND HE IMMEDIATELY FELT PEACE IN HIS HEART
cv-valid-test/sample-002870.mp3,WE WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT WE'RE ALL FOR YOU
cv-valid-test/sample-002871.mp3,SHE CAN'T GET AWAY
cv-valid-test/sample-002872.mp3,NOT EVERYONE CAN SEE HIS DREAMS COME TRUE IN OUR SAME RAY
cv-valid-test/sample-002873.mp3,HE LISTENED TO THE WINDAND FELT THE STONES BENEATH HIS FEET
cv-valid-test/sample-002874.mp3,THE MELENIUM EDITION OF THE ALBUM CONTAINS MULTIPLE REMETIES AND THE LYRICS
cv-valid-test/sample-002875.mp3,IT SPREAD THROUGH THE PLANET'S ATMOSPHERE AND OBSCURED ITS MORE FAMILIAR FEATURES

cv-valid-test/sample-002877.mp3,MY REVIEW OF THE SUN ONE STAR
cv-valid-test/sample-002878.mp3,I THOUGHT ABOUT WHETHER WE SHOULD FIND COINS AND MODELS IN IT AND SO ON

cv-valid-test/sample-002880.mp3,IT MUST HAVE FALLEN WHILE I WAS SIDDEN WER THERE

cv-valid-test/sample-002883.mp3,THE PAPER PRESENTS A VARIANT OF A HIDDEN MARKAL MODEL FOR IMAGES
cv-valid-test/sample-002884.mp3,WE LIT THE LANTERN AND WALKED OVER TO HIS HOUSE
cv-valid-test/sample-002885.mp3,TODAY I UNDERSTAND SOMETHING I DIDN'T SEE BEFORE EVERY BLESSING IGNORED BECOMES A CURSE
cv-valid-test/sample-002886.mp3,THEY BECOME A PART OF EVERYTHING
cv-valid-test/sample-002887.mp3,THE TRICKY PART IS INTEGRATING IT WITH DRAGON FLY
cv-valid-test/sample-002888.mp3,THE BOY WAS SHOCKED
cv-valid-test/sample-002889.mp3,SHE COMES BY IT NATURALLY
cv-valid-test/sample-002890.mp3,YOU HAVEN'T TOLD ME
cv-valid-test/sample-002891.mp3,THE LEVEN VERGIN PEARED RE INTENSITY
cv-valid-test/sample-002892.mp3,WHAT IS IT THAT I STILL NEED TO KNOW THE BOY ASKED
cv-valid-test/sample-002893.mp3,A BOY RECALLED THE BRILLIANCE HE HAD NOTICED ON THE PREVIOUS DAY
cv-valid-test/sample-002894.mp3,I'VE HAD THE SAME DREAM TWICE HE SAID
cv-valid-test/sample-002895.mp3,I'M GOING TO GET MY ARM FIXED OUT OF THIS
cv-valid-test/sample-002896.mp3,HE DID FIND IT SOON AFTER DAWN AND NOT FAR FROM THE SAND PITS
cv-valid-test/sample-002897.mp3,I NEED SOME COFFEE
cv-valid-test/sample-002898.mp3,AND AT THAT I TOLD HIM AND HE TOOK MY PLACE
cv-valid-test/sample-002899.mp3,IT'S NOT SO BAD
cv-valid-test/sample-002900.mp3,BUT EVERYTHING HAD CHANGED
cv-valid-test/sample-002901.mp3,HE HAD USED THE TWO STONES ONLY ONCE ONE MORNING WHEN HE WAS AT A MARKET PLACE
cv-valid-test/sample-002902.mp3,THAT'S RATHER A BIG TALKED
cv-valid-test/sample-002903.mp3,I GOT A FIGURE SOME WAY OUT OF THIS THING
cv-valid-test/sample-002904.mp3,HUNDREDS MUST HAVE SEEN IT AND TAKEN IT FOR A FALLING STAR
cv-valid-test/sample-002905.mp3,I WISHED I HAD A LIGHT TO SMOOKBOY
cv-valid-test/sample-002906.mp3,IT WAS GLARINGLY HOT NOT A CLOUD IN THE SKY NOR A BREATH OF WIND

cv-valid-test/sample-002925.mp3,WHAT'S THE FIFTH OBLIGATION THE BOY ASKED
cv-valid-test/sample-002926.mp3,HE WASN'T ASKING FOR HELP
cv-valid-test/sample-002927.mp3,FROM THERE HE COULD SEE AFRICA IN THE DISTANCE
cv-valid-test/sample-002928.mp3,ALL THEY WANTED WAS FOOD AND WATER
cv-valid-test/sample-002929.mp3,IT WAS THERE THAT THE WISE MAN LIVED
cv-valid-test/sample-002930.mp3,THE TWO WERE TAKEN TO A NEARBY MILITARY CAMP
cv-valid-test/sample-002931.mp3,THEN HE TURNED TO THE BOY AND THIS TIME HIS EXPRESSION WAS COLD AND DISTANT
cv-valid-test/sample-002932.mp3,I SWEAR IT ON MY MOTHER'S GRAVE
cv-valid-test/sample-002933.mp3,I LOCKED EYES WITH A FISH IN THE TANK
cv-valid-test/sample-002934.mp3,THE INSURGENTS GATHERED STICKS AND WOOD

cv-valid-test/sample-002938.mp3,IN ANY CASE IT'S GOOD THAT YOU HAVE LEARNED THAT EVERYTHING IN LIFE HAS ITS PLACE
cv-valid-test/sample-002939.mp3,HE HAD SEEN THE SHOOTING STAR AND WAS PERSUADED THAT A METEORITE LAY SOMEWHERE NEARBY
cv-valid-test/sample-002940.mp3,THE CROWD SWAYED A LITTLE AS I ELBOWED MY WAY THROUGH
cv-valid-test/sample-002941.mp3,SHOW THE TANTS FOR ANIMATED MOVIES IN THE NEAREST MOVING HOUSE

cv-valid-test/sample-002943.mp3,THE MIXTURE TOOK ON A REDDISH COLOR ALMOST THE COLOR OF BLOOD
cv-valid-test/sample-002944.mp3,THE ALCHEMIST WAS A BIT TROMTING BUT AS THE BOY DRANK THE WINE HE RELAXED
cv-valid-test/sample-002945.mp3,AN ALCHEMIST SAID THE ALCHEMIST
cv-valid-test/sample-002946.mp3,AND ALSO BECAUSE I KNOW ABOUT THE SOUL OF THE WORLD HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF

cv-valid-test/sample-002957.mp3,IT WAS SUCH A GRADUAL MOVEMENT THAT HE FOUND IT ONLY BY NOTICING THE DOTS
cv-valid-test/sample-002958.mp3,THEN THE THING CAME UPON HIM IN A FLASH
cv-valid-test/sample-002959.mp3,BUT MAYBE PEOPLE WHO THOUGHT THAT WAY HAD NEVER LEARNED THE UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE

cv-valid-test/sample-002966.mp3,THE SAME HAND THAT HAD BRANDISHED THE SWARD NOW HELD A WHIP
cv-valid-test/sample-002967.mp3,HOUGH THE BOY WAS DISAPPOINTED IT DECIDED THAT HE WOULD NEVER GAIN BELIEVE IN DREAMS
cv-valid-test/sample-002968.mp3,IN THOSE TIMES THE MASTER WORK COULD BE WRITTEN SIMPLY ON AN EMERALD
cv-valid-test/sample-002969.mp3,SOMETHING JUST BRUFY

cv-valid-test/sample-002988.mp3,THE BOOK THAT MOST INTERESTED THE BOY TOLD THE STORIES OF THE FAMOUS ALCHEMISTS
cv-valid-test/sample-002989.mp3,HE NEXD WITH SOMEONE TO TALK TO SO AS TO AVOID THINKING ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF WAR
cv-valid-test/sample-002990.mp3,HE TRIED AGAIN TO CONCENTRATE ON THE PINK SHADES OF THE DESERT AND ITS STONES
cv-valid-test/sample-002991.mp3,FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS
cv-valid-test/sample-002992.mp3,FIFTY CENTS ON THE DOLLAR
cv-valid-test/sample-002993.mp3,THEY LOCKED THEMSELVES IN THEIR LABORATORIES AND TRIED TO EVOLVE AS GOLD HAD
cv-valid-test/sample-002994.mp3,ONE DAY THE EARTH BEGAN TO TREMBLE AND THE NILE OVERFLOWED ITS BANKS
cv-valid-test/sample-002995.mp3,WHATEVER THE THINK OFSERVED ONE COULD FIND A CONNECTION WITH HIS EXPERIENCE OF THE MOMENT
cv-valid-test/sample-002996.mp3,IT'S ALWAYS NICE IF YOU CAN LEARN SOMETHING NEW ISN'T IT
cv-valid-test/sample-002997.mp3,I'VE GOT TO DECORATE MY TREE
cv-valid-test/sample-002998.mp3,JUST TEACH ME TO BE THE WIND FOR A FEW MOMENTS THE BOY SAID
cv-valid-test/sample-002999.mp3,ROGER THE BACKUP TIM IS ON THE WAY
cv-valid-test/sample-003000.mp3,IT DREW A DROPLET OF BLOOD
cv-valid-test/sample-003001.mp3,THE BRIGHT FLUTE WAS LOOKING OUT ONTO THE PATH
cv-valid-test/sample-003002.mp3,THEN THE THING CAME UPON HIM IN A FLASH
cv-valid-test/sample-003003.mp3,THEN SUDDENLY HE NOTICED IT WITH A START
cv-valid-test/sample-003004.mp3,MILCHISADECK WATCHED A SMALL SHIP THAT WAS PLOGING ITS WAY OUT OF THE PORT
cv-valid-test/sample-003005.mp3,I TOLD HIM WE COULD TEACH HER TO IGNORE PEOPLE WHO WASTE HER TIME
cv-valid-test/sample-003006.mp3,ON THE FOLLOWING DAY THE FIRST CLY SIGN OF DANGER APPEARED
cv-valid-test/sample-003007.mp3,HUNCHES HIS MOTHER USED TO CALL THEM
cv-valid-test/sample-003008.mp3,GO INTO YOUR DENSE
cv-valid-test/sample-003009.mp3,DARIN NEVER SAW A BOTTLE TILL HE WAS SIX MONTHS OLD
cv-valid-test/sample-003010.mp3,THE BOY STEPPED CLOSER TO THE GULL AND WHEN SHE SMILED HE DID THE SAME
cv-valid-test/sample-003011.mp3,THE BOY WAS SHOCKED
cv-valid-test/sample-003012.mp3,IT LOOKED LIKE A RUSTY GAS FLOAT
cv-valid-test/sample-003013.mp3,THE MAN WAS SPEAKING THE LANGUAGE OF ALCHEMY
cv-valid-test/sample-003014.mp3,THE ENGLISHMAN WAS DISAPPOINTED
cv-valid-test/sample-003015.mp3,TOMORROW SELL YOUR CAMEL AND BUY A HORSE
cv-valid-test/sample-003016.mp3,LOOKING AROUND HE SOUGHT HIS SHEEP AND THEN REALIZED THAT HE WAS IN A NEW WORLD

cv-valid-test/sample-003018.mp3,ALOSHKI SUDDENLY CAME OFF AND FELL WITH A LOUD AND SHARP NOISE
cv-valid-test/sample-003019.mp3,WHEN YOU'RE IN LOVE THINGS MAKE EVEN MORE SENSE HE THOUGHT
cv-valid-test/sample-003020.mp3,YOU DON'T CALL THIS A CONVENIENCE
cv-valid-test/sample-003021.mp3,THEY ALSO HOGED THE GUIDE TO FEEL THAT THEY KNEW BETTER WAYS THAN OTHERS HAD
cv-valid-test/sample-003022.mp3,BUT I LIKE IT THAT WAY
cv-valid-test/sample-003023.mp3,IT WAS ONLY WORDS
cv-valid-test/sample-003024.mp3,THE INTERNET SHOULD REFLECT ALL OF THE PEOPLE WHO USE IT
cv-valid-test/sample-003025.mp3,IT WAS OUR MONEY AND WE WANTED BACK
cv-valid-test/sample-003026.mp3,AND HE TOLD WHAT HE HAD SEEN
cv-valid-test/sample-003027.mp3,WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS
cv-valid-test/sample-003028.mp3,MED DREAM MORE ABOUT COMING HOME THAN ABOUT LANING THE BOY SAID

cv-valid-test/sample-003030.mp3,HE WALKED SLOWLY THROUGH THE MARKET
cv-valid-test/sample-003031.mp3,MOST OF THEM WERE STARING QUIETLY AT THE BIG TABLE
cv-valid-test/sample-003032.mp3,WHY THE SHOTS STOPPED AFTER THE TENTH NO ONE ON EARTH HAS TRIED TO EXPLAIN
cv-valid-test/sample-003033.mp3,I HEARD A FAINT MOVEMENT UNDER MY FEET
cv-valid-test/sample-003034.mp3,ONE MINUTE AGO
cv-valid-test/sample-003035.mp3,HE WAS TWENTY MINUTES FROM HIS TENT AND BEGAN TO MAKE HIS WAY THERE
cv-valid-test/sample-003036.mp3,BECAUSE YOU'RE TRYING TO REALIZE YOUR DESTINY
cv-valid-test/sample-003037.mp3,BUT INSTEAD OF BEING SADDENED HE WAS HAPPY
cv-valid-test/sample-003038.mp3,I DON'T WANT TO TAKE ANY CHANCES
cv-valid-test/sample-003039.mp3,ALL YOU'VE GOT TO DO WIS TALK TO HIM
cv-valid-test/sample-003040.mp3,THAT'S WHY I KEEP LOSING

cv-valid-test/sample-003045.mp3,OGELVY TOLD HIM EVERYTHING THAT HE HAD SEEN
cv-valid-test/sample-003046.mp3,BUT HE KEPT A SWORD IN HIS CARRIAGE
cv-valid-test/sample-003047.mp3,BECAUSE I DON'T LOVE HIM
cv-valid-test/sample-003048.mp3,YET IT WAS A LITTLE TOO LARGE FOR ASSURANCE
cv-valid-test/sample-003049.mp3,IT LEFT TASHENIS STREEK THAT GLUED FOR SOME SECONDS
cv-valid-test/sample-003050.mp3,I HEARD A PECULIAR HUMMING SOUND FROM THE PIT
cv-valid-test/sample-003051.mp3,HE DID FIND IT SOON AFTER DAWN AND NOT FAR FROM THE SAND PITS
cv-valid-test/sample-003052.mp3,ALL I WANT TO DO IS TO BE LET ALONE
cv-valid-test/sample-003053.mp3,SHE NEVER TOLD HER THAT
cv-valid-test/sample-003054.mp3,SERVANTS CAME AND WENT WITH SILVER TRAYS LADEN WITH SPICES AND TEA
cv-valid-test/sample-003055.mp3,THEY ALL COMPLAIN THEY'RE PRACTICALLY WORKING FOR THE GOVERNMENT

cv-valid-test/sample-003063.mp3,THE BOY FELT ILL AND TERRIBLY ALERN
cv-valid-test/sample-003064.mp3,DOWN BELOW IN THE DARKNESS WERE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE SLEEPING IN PEACE
cv-valid-test/sample-003065.mp3,THE DAY WAS STAWNING AND THE SHEPHERD URGED HIS SHEEP IN THE DIRECTION OF THE SUN
cv-valid-test/sample-003066.mp3,THEN KNOCK MY SHEEP ANY MORE HE SAID TO HIMSELF WITHOUT NOUSTAGIA
cv-valid-test/sample-003067.mp3,LET'S CALL HIM UP
cv-valid-test/sample-003068.mp3,HE TOOK THE FOURTH PART AND HANDED IT TO THE MONK
cv-valid-test/sample-003069.mp3,HE TOOK OUT ONE OF THE STONES
cv-valid-test/sample-003070.mp3,THE ELEVEN TAR INCREASED IN INTENSITY
cv-valid-test/sample-003071.mp3,DURING THE THIRD YEAR THE OMENS WILL CONTINUE TO SPEAK OF YOUR TREASURE AND YOUR DESTINY

cv-valid-test/sample-003130.mp3,DOWN BELOW IN THE DARKNESS WERE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE SLEEPING IN PEACE
cv-valid-test/sample-003131.mp3,WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE WHAT TIME IT IS

cv-valid-test/sample-003234.mp3,ABOUT ELEVEN I WALKED BACK TO MY HOME IN MAYBURY BECAUSE NOTHING SEEMED TO BE HAPPENING
cv-valid-test/sample-003235.mp3,BUT NOWHERE COULD HE FIND HIS NEW COMPANION
cv-valid-test/sample-003236.mp3,HE GOT UP EARLY WITH THE IDEA OF FINDING IT
cv-valid-test/sample-003237.mp3,WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S IN THE CONFOUNDED THING DO YOU
cv-valid-test/sample-003238.mp3,IT SEEMED SO SAFE AND TRANQUIL
cv-valid-test/sample-003239.mp3,THAT MAKES SENSE THE ALCHEMIST ANSWERED
cv-valid-test/sample-003240.mp3,HE STUCK HIS HAND INTO THE POUCH AND FELT AROUND FOR ONE OF THE STONES
cv-valid-test/sample-003241.mp3,THERE WAS A FULL MOON AND THE BOY TOLD THE ENGLISHMAN THE STORY OF HIS LIFE

cv-valid-test/sample-003247.mp3,BUT SHE SAID NOTHING
cv-valid-test/sample-003248.mp3,I THINK THEY PERCEIVED THAT NOTHING WAS TO BE DONE AT THE MOMENT
cv-valid-test/sample-003249.mp3,THERE WERE MOUNTAINS IN THE DISTANCE
cv-valid-test/sample-003250.mp3,LOOKING UP HE SAW A PAIR OF HOOKS FLYING HIGH IN THE SKY
cv-valid-test/sample-003251.mp3,I DON'T BLAME THEM
cv-valid-test/sample-003252.mp3,I KNOWI WHY I WANT TO GET BACK TO MY FLUCK HE THOUGHT

cv-valid-test/sample-003274.mp3,WHY WAS IT THAT HE WANTED THE BOY TO SERVE AS HIS INSTRUMENT
cv-valid-test/sample-003275.mp3,BUT WHEN THE REIGN OF TIBERIUS ENDED HIS POEMS WERE FORGOTTEN
cv-valid-test/sample-003276.mp3,HENDERSON STOOD UP WITH A SPADE IN HIS HAND
cv-valid-test/sample-003277.mp3,I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE DESERT SAID
cv-valid-test/sample-003278.mp3,AT THE CAMP IT WAS DIFFICULT TO SEE ANYTHING
cv-valid-test/sample-003279.mp3,THE LAND WAS RUINED AND I HAD TO FIND SOME OTHER WAY TO EARN A LIVING
cv-valid-test/sample-003280.mp3,IF SOMEONE ISN'T WHAT OTHERS WANT THEM TO BE THE OTHERS BECOME ANGRY
cv-valid-test/sample-003281.mp3,THE OTHER BLEW WAR

cv-valid-test/sample-003288.mp3,HE WAS IMMENSELY EXCITED AT THE NEWS
cv-valid-test/sample-003289.mp3,I LOCKED EYES WITH A FISH IN THE TUNK

cv-valid-test/sample-003293.mp3,THE WIND SCREAMED WITH DELIGHT AND BLEW HARDER THAN EVER
cv-valid-test/sample-003294.mp3,AND TO LOOK HOW MANY THINGS THE WIND ALREADY KNEW HOW TO DO
cv-valid-test/sample-003295.mp3,I POINTED OUT MARS A BRIGHT DOT OF LIGHT
cv-valid-test/sample-003296.mp3,ONE BY ONE THE CAMP FIRES WERE EXTINGUISHED AND THE OASES FELL AS QUIET AS THE DESERT
cv-valid-test/sample-003297.mp3,HE HAD ALREADY SEEN MANY PEOPLE COME AND GO AND THE DESERT REMAINED AS IT WAS
cv-valid-test/sample-003298.mp3,THAT SOVERED HIM A LITTLE
cv-valid-test/sample-003299.mp3,I'M GOING TO TELL HER WHAT I THINK OF HER
cv-valid-test/sample-003300.mp3,HE FOLLOWED THE MOVEMENT OF THE BIRDS TRYING TO READ SOMETHING INTO IT
cv-valid-test/sample-003301.mp3,HE SHOULD HAVE DECIDED TO BECOME A SHEPHERD THE BOY SAI

cv-valid-test/sample-003305.mp3,DON'T HURT MY FINGER AGAIN
cv-valid-test/sample-003306.mp3,UNTIL THEN HE HAD CONSIDERED THE OMENS TO BE THINGS OF THIS WORLD
cv-valid-test/sample-003307.mp3,HE PAID FOR THE WOOF AND ASKED THE SHEPHERD TO COME BACK THE FOLLOWING YEAR
cv-valid-test/sample-003308.mp3,AS HE LOOKED AT THE STONES HE FELT RELIEVED FOR SOME REASON
cv-valid-test/sample-003309.mp3,THE TIME MUST HAVE BEEN SOMEWHERE ROUND SIX O'CLOCK
cv-valid-test/sample-003310.mp3,AND YET NONE OF THESE PEOPLE HAS EVER MET THE OLD KING
cv-valid-test/sample-003311.mp3,THE BOY WAS ALSO SADDENED HIS FRIEND WAS IN PURSUIT OF HIS DESTINY
cv-valid-test/sample-003312.mp3,IT ALWAYS HELPS TO BE LEARNING SOMETHING NEW AND EXCITING
cv-valid-test/sample-003313.mp3,I'M GOING TO BECOME BITTER AND DISTRUSTFUL OF PEOPLE BECAUSE ONE PERSON BETRAYED ME
cv-valid-test/sample-003314.mp3,I'LL MAKE SUCH A MESS OF THINGS WITHOUT YOU

cv-valid-test/sample-003321.mp3,THE GODS SHOULDN'T HAVE DESIRES BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE DESTINIES
cv-valid-test/sample-003322.mp3,AND THEY ATTACKED AN EMPTY TENT
cv-valid-test/sample-003323.mp3,SOME STORMS ARE WORSH THE WRECKAGE

cv-valid-test/sample-003486.mp3,THEN IT BECAME A SIGNAL OF DANGER
cv-valid-test/sample-003487.mp3,COMING HOME A PARTY OF TOURISTS PASSED US SINGING AND PLAYING MUSICWE
cv-valid-test/sample-003488.mp3,THE HEATHER WAS ON FIRE AND YOU COULD SEE A THIN BLUE SMOKE RISING UP SLOWLY
cv-valid-test/sample-003489.mp3,WHERE'S THE TREASURE HE ASKED
cv-valid-test/sample-003490.mp3,SO THAT WAS IT
cv-valid-test/sample-003491.mp3,BUTTER BRING ME A GLASS OF MILK
cv-valid-test/sample-003492.mp3,HE SAW THAT FACHIMA'S EYES WERE FILLED WITH TEARS
cv-valid-test/sample-003493.mp3,THEY WERE PEOPLE OF THE DESERT AND CLAMORED TO HEAR HIS STORIES ABOUT THE GREAT CITIES
cv-valid-test/sample-003494.mp3,THEN ONE DAY THE BOY RETURNED THE BOOKS TO THE ENGLISHMAN
cv-valid-test/sample-003495.mp3,SHE LEARNED HOW TO PLAY THE PIANO IN A MUSIC SCHOOL
cv-valid-test/sample-003496.mp3,BUT I'M GOING TO EGYPT THE BOY SAID
cv-valid-test/sample-003497.mp3,YOU KILLED ALL THREE OF THEM FOR NOTHING
cv-valid-test/sample-003498.mp3,HE WAS LEARNING A LOT OF NEW THINGS
cv-valid-test/sample-003499.mp3,MANY PEOPLE IN BERKSHIRE SURREY AND MIDDLESEX MUST HAVE SEEN IT
cv-valid-test/sample-003500.mp3,IS MUCH LESS SENSITIVE TO SPURIOUS AWAKENINGS THAN THE SLEEP MODE
cv-valid-test/sample-003501.mp3,THE SHEEP HAD TOLD HIM THAT
cv-valid-test/sample-003502.mp3,I WAS JUST GOING TO
cv-valid-test/sample-003503.mp3,FOR AT THAT TIME IT HAD NOT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT IT MIGHT BE HOLLOW
cv-valid-test/sample-003504.mp3,ABSOLUTELY DESPICABLE THAT GINGERBREAD MEN ARE FORCED TO LIVE IN HOUSES MADE OF THEIR OWN FLESH
cv-valid-test/sample-003505.mp3,WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S IN THE CONFOUNDED THING DO YOU
cv-valid-test/sample-003506.mp3,YOU MUST ALWAYS KNOW WHAT IT IS THAT YOU WANT THE OLD KING HAD SAID
cv-valid-test/sample-003507.mp3,THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING TO DO
cv-valid-test/sample-003508.mp3,MOST METEORITES ARE MORE OR LESS ROUNDED
cv-valid-test/sample-003509.mp3,MY SEVEN YEAR RESUME GAP SMARKED NOT DRUKS
cv-valid-test/sample-003510.mp3,DID YOU HEAR WHAT I SAID
cv-valid-test/sample-003511.mp3,THE CRIMINALS TAUNTED THE POLICE OFFICERS AND PRISON GUARDS
cv-valid-test/sample-003512.mp3,THE STRANGER WAS SPEAKING OF THINGS THAT VERY FEW PEOPLE KNEW ABOUT
cv-valid-test/sample-003513.mp3,I MYSELF HEARD NOTHING OF THAT
cv-valid-test/sample-003514.mp3,IN SPITE OF THIS I STILL BELIEVED THAT THERE WERE MEN IN MARS
cv-valid-test/sample-003515.mp3,BUT THE BOY WAS CERTAIN THAT HE HAD BEEN LOOKING AT THEM
cv-valid-test/sample-003516.mp3,YOU GOT PLENTY OF MONEY
cv-valid-test/sample-003517.mp3,BUT THE MERCHANT UNDERSTOOD WHAT THE BOY HAD SAID
cv-valid-test/sample-003518.mp3,THE LEVEL GROUND WAS BLACKENED AS FAR AS ONE COULD SEE AND IT WAS STILL GIVING OFF SMOKE
cv-valid-test/sample-003519.mp3,YOU POINT TO A TRAIL OF ANTS LEADING INTO THE HOUSE
cv-valid-test/sample-003520.mp3,HOW MANY PEOPLE DO YOU THINK WILL BE THERE
cv-valid-test/sample-003521.mp3,COME ON WITH THAT MONEY
cv-valid-test/sample-003522.mp3,THE BOY SAW A MAN APPEAR BEHIND THE COUNTER
cv-valid-test/sample-003523.mp3,WHY THE SHOPS STOPPED AFTER THE TENTH NO ONE ON EARTH HAS TRIED TO EXPLAIN
cv-valid-test/sample-003524.mp3,IT WAS NO MORE EXCITING THAN AN OVERTURNED CARRIAGE OR A TREE BLOWN ACROSS THE ROAD
cv-valid-test/sample-003525.mp3,I WANTED THEM TO BE A PART OF YOUR INHERITANCE
cv-valid-test/sample-003526.mp3,I'ME STILL HAVING TROUBLE WITH BAKING
cv-valid-test/sample-003527.mp3,THE BOY WAS SURPRISED AT HIS THOUGHTS
cv-valid-test/sample-003528.mp3,WE DON'T KNOW WHEN THE WAR WILL END SO WE CAN'T CONTINUE OUR JOURNEY HE SAID
cv-valid-test/sample-003529.mp3,CAN'T THEY SEE IT'S A FRAME UP
cv-valid-test/sample-003530.mp3,IS SHERIFF HELEN IN THERE
cv-valid-test/sample-003531.mp3,IT WAS BETTER THAN THE SCENT OF THE HOOKAS
cv-valid-test/sample-003532.mp3,IT HAS HAPPENED MANY TIMES BEFORE
cv-valid-test/sample-003533.mp3,THIS IS FOR THE BOY
cv-valid-test/sample-003534.mp3,HE RESTARTED HIS EFFORTS FOR THE TWENTIETH TIME
cv-valid-test/sample-003535.mp3,DON'T LISTEN TO THAT
cv-valid-test/sample-003536.mp3,HE RAN HIS FINGERS SLOWLY OVER THE STONES SENSING THEIR TEMPERATURE AND FEELING THEIR SURFACES
cv-valid-test/sample-003537.mp3,YOU CAN'T GO ANY FARTHER ONE OF THEM SAID
cv-valid-test/sample-003538.mp3,GYPSIES ARE EXPERTS ON GETTING PEOPLE TO DO THAT SIGHED THE OLD MAN
cv-valid-test/sample-003539.mp3,BECAUSE THEY'RE STILL HERE
cv-valid-test/sample-003540.mp3,AT ONCE HE CONNECTED THE TWO INCIDENTS
cv-valid-test/sample-003541.mp3,THE FACT THAT THE TWO HOURS HAD STRETCHED INTO AN ENTIRE YEAR DIDN'T MATTER
cv-valid-test/sample-003542.mp3,MAYBE NO ONE HERE KNOWS WHAT AN ALCHEMIST IS
cv-valid-test/sample-003543.mp3,DIVERS FOUND A DEAD PERSON IN THE LAKE
cv-valid-test/sample-003544.mp3,THE SHOP FOLKS WERE TAKING DOWN THEIR SHUTTERS AND PEOPLE WERE OPENING THEIR BEDROOM WINDOWS
cv-valid-test/sample-003545.mp3,HERE'S TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS
cv-valid-test/sample-003546.mp3,BUT BAKERS ARE MORE IMPORTUNTE PEOPLE THAN SHEPHERDS
cv-valid-test/sample-003547.mp3,MY TAX DOLLARS PAY FOR THOSE PUBLIC SCHOOL PROMS
cv-valid-test/sample-003548.mp3,THEY'RE FORMING CLUBS
cv-valid-test/sample-003549.mp3,BUT THEY COULD NEVER HAVE TAUGHT HIM ARABIC
cv-valid-test/sample-003550.mp3,WE'VE BEEN TAKING FOR A LOT OF SUCKERS
cv-valid-test/sample-003551.mp3,WHERE IS ASHLEY SWALLARED
cv-valid-test/sample-003552.mp3,THEY'RE STARTING TO THROW THINGS
cv-valid-test/sample-003553.mp3,SO HOW WILL WE NAME ALL THESE HURRICANS
cv-valid-test/sample-003554.mp3,SO YOU GOT MARRIED
cv-valid-test/sample-003555.mp3,YOU SHOULD NEVER CROSS THE STREET WHEN THE TRAFFIC LIGHT SHOWS RED
cv-valid-test/sample-003556.mp3,THE STREAMER OF GAS CAME OUT TOWARDS US
cv-valid-test/sample-003557.mp3,THEY BOTH SPOKE THE SAME LANGUAGE
cv-valid-test/sample-003558.mp3,WHY DIDN'T I CALL YOU BACK
cv-valid-test/sample-003559.mp3,I WANT TO TALK TO YOU
cv-valid-test/sample-003560.mp3,HE HAD FOUND WHERE HIS TREASURE WAS AND WAS FRIGHTENED AT WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN
cv-valid-test/sample-003561.mp3,YOU GOT YOUR SEA LEGS YET
cv-valid-test/sample-003562.mp3,I HAD SEEN ALL THAT IT WOULD PRESENTLY BRING ME
cv-valid-test/sample-003563.mp3,I HEARD A PECULIAR HUMMING SOUND FROM THE PIT
cv-valid-test/sample-003564.mp3,IT SEEMED SO SAVE AND AND CRIL
cv-valid-test/sample-003565.mp3,NO ONE SEEMED TO HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT IT THAT NIGHT
cv-valid-test/sample-003566.mp3,THERE WERE THREE HUNDRED BELLS FIFTY THOUSAND DATREES AND INNUMERABLE COLOR TUNS SPREAD AMONG THEM
cv-valid-test/sample-003567.mp3,IN SPITE OF THIS I STILL BELIEVED THAT THERE WERE MEN IN MARS
cv-valid-test/sample-003568.mp3,THE ALCHEMIST TURNED TO THE BOY
cv-valid-test/sample-003569.mp3,BUT THIS PAYMENT GOES WELL BEYOND MY GENEROSITY THE MARK RESPONDED
cv-valid-test/sample-003570.mp3,SUDDENLY THE MONSTER DISAPPEARED
cv-valid-test/sample-003571.mp3,THE BOY CAME RUNNING TOWARDS ME
cv-valid-test/sample-003572.mp3,I HAVE THE MONEY I NEED TO BUY MY SHEEP
cv-valid-test/sample-003573.mp3,HE BECAME FRIENDLY WITH THE CAMEL RAVER WHO TRAVELLED ALONGSIDE HIM
cv-valid-test/sample-003574.mp3,SOME WENT ER AWHILE WHILE I WAS THERE AND OTHER PEOPLE CAME
cv-valid-test/sample-003575.mp3,WHO TOLD YOU THAT AT THE BOY DESERVED
cv-valid-test/sample-003576.mp3,AND THEN HE PERCEIVED IT VERY SLOWLY
cv-valid-test/sample-003577.mp3,LISTEN TO THAT MOB
cv-valid-test/sample-003578.mp3,FROM THE RAILWAY STATION IN THE DISTANCE CAME THE SOUND OF TRAINS RINGING AND RUMBLING
cv-valid-test/sample-003579.mp3,THE FOOL FLEW ALL THE WAY UP HERE IN A BLIZZARD
cv-valid-test/sample-003580.mp3,GO ON OUT AND GET RID OF IT
cv-valid-test/sample-003581.mp3,I'LL HAVE NED RIGHT IT UP
cv-valid-test/sample-003582.mp3,SHE WROTE THE STUFF
cv-valid-test/sample-003583.mp3,THE IRISHMAN SIPPED HIS TEA
cv-valid-test/sample-003584.mp3,I'M AFRAID THAT IF MY DREAM IS REALIZED I'LL HAVE NO REASON TO GO ON LIVING
cv-valid-test/sample-003585.mp3,EXPERTS OF GEOLOGY AGREE YESTERDAY'S SUNAMI WAS ADJUSTA HERALD OF THE IMMINENT APOCALYPS
cv-valid-test/sample-003586.mp3,WHENEVER HE COULD HE SOUGHT OUT A NEW ROAD TO TRAVEL
cv-valid-test/sample-003587.mp3,AT THIS HOUR OF THE MORNING
cv-valid-test/sample-003588.mp3,I REMEMBER HOW I SAT ON THE TABLE THERE IN THE BLACKNESS WITH PATCHES OF GREEN AND CRIMSON SWIMMING BEFORE MY EYES
cv-valid-test/sample-003589.mp3,MAKEROOM FOR MISSUS CHELSEY
cv-valid-test/sample-003590.mp3,YOU DON'T KNOW WHO DID IT

cv-valid-test/sample-003594.mp3,GOT TO GET SOME PRACTICE
cv-valid-test/sample-003595.mp3,CASPER PREDICTED THE OUTCOME
cv-valid-test/sample-003596.mp3,THE BOY REMINDED THE OLD MAN THAT HE HAD SAID SOMETHING ABOUT HIDDEN TREASUR
cv-valid-test/sample-003597.mp3,THIS WAS THE STRANGEST OF FOUR THINGS THAT EVER CAME TO EARTH FROM OUTER SPACE
cv-valid-test/sample-003598.mp3,AND YOUR CAMELS WILL BRING YOU WEALTH AND POWER
cv-valid-test/sample-003599.mp3,IT WAS BETTER THAN THE SCENT OF THE HOOKAHS
cv-valid-test/sample-003600.mp3,TOMORROW SELL YOUR CAMEL AND BUY A HORSE
cv-valid-test/sample-003601.mp3,OGILVY WATCHED TILL ONE AND THEN GAVE UP

cv-valid-test/sample-003604.mp3,THE MAN WEPT WITH HAPPINESS
cv-valid-test/sample-003605.mp3,HE COULDN'T HAVE BEEN WRONG
cv-valid-test/sample-003606.mp3,THE WORLD SPEAKS MANY LANGUAGES THE BOY THOUGHT
cv-valid-test/sample-003607.mp3,THE ONE IN THERE
cv-valid-test/sample-003608.mp3,HE DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING ELSE
cv-valid-test/sample-003609.mp3,I WAS DISAPPOINTED AT THIS INANIMATE FULGI WAS DISAPPOINTED AT THIS INANIMATE FLG
cv-valid-test/sample-003610.mp3,THEY WENT ON SMOKING THE PIPE FOR A WHILE AS THE SUN BEGAN TO SET
cv-valid-test/sample-003611.mp3,THE BATTLES MAY LAST FOR A LONG TIME PERHAPS EVEN YEARS
cv-valid-test/sample-003612.mp3,IT WAS A KIND OF FASCINATION THAT PARALYSED MY ACTIONS
cv-valid-test/sample-003613.mp3,THIS IS FOR YOU HE SAID HOLDING ONE OF THE PARTS OUT TO THE MONK
cv-valid-test/sample-003614.mp3,LET US IN ON IT
cv-valid-test/sample-003615.mp3,EVEN THEN HE HARDLY UNDERSTOOD WHAT THIS MEANT
cv-valid-test/sample-003616.mp3,THE BOY NOTICED THAT THE MAN'S CLOTHING WAS STRANGE
cv-valid-test/sample-003617.mp3,I'VE BEEN TO YOUR HOUSE A HUNDRED TIMES
cv-valid-test/sample-003618.mp3,THE BOY WAS RELIEVED
cv-valid-test/sample-003619.mp3,REVENGE IS NOT MY STYLE BUT OBVIOUSLY ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN
cv-valid-test/sample-003620.mp3,IT IS I WHO DARED TO DO SO SAID THE BOY
cv-valid-test/sample-003621.mp3,CURSE THE MOMENT I MET THAT OLD MAN HE THOUGHT
cv-valid-test/sample-003622.mp3,IT'S ALL RIGHT IF YOU WARN'T SMOKE YOUR CIGAR NOW
cv-valid-test/sample-003623.mp3,THE BOY WAS SHAKING WITH FEAR BUT THE ALCHEMIST HELPED HIM OUT OF THE TENT
cv-valid-test/sample-003624.mp3,WHAT'S SHE UP TO
cv-valid-test/sample-003625.mp3,WHAT DID YOU STOP IT FOR
cv-valid-test/sample-003626.mp3,HE TOLD ABOUT THE MORNING'S MEETING
cv-valid-test/sample-003627.mp3,DO YOU REALIZE WHAT YOU'VE DONE
cv-valid-test/sample-003628.mp3,SCATTERED GROUPS OF PEOPLE WERE HURRYING FROM THE DIRECTION OF WALKING
cv-valid-test/sample-003629.mp3,MARK UNTAPED THE PACKAGE CAREFULLY
cv-valid-test/sample-003630.mp3,I FOUND A LITTLE CROWD ABOUT TWENTY EQUILS ARRIDING IN THE HUGE HOOL
cv-valid-test/sample-003631.mp3,HE THOUGHT OF THE MERCHANT'S DAUGHTER AND WAS SURE THAT SHE HAD PROBABLY MARRIED
cv-valid-test/sample-003632.mp3,I HAVE THE DIET OF A KID WHO FOUND TWENTY DOLLARS
cv-valid-test/sample-003633.mp3,I HAVE ALREADY FOUND MY TREASURE
cv-valid-test/sample-003634.mp3,THE BOY WAS SHOCKED
cv-valid-test/sample-003635.mp3,IT SPOKE OF JOURNEYS DISCOVERIES BOOKS AND CHANGE
cv-valid-test/sample-003636.mp3,THE TOP OF THE CYLINDER WAS ROTATING ON ITS BODY
cv-valid-test/sample-003637.mp3,THE NAVY'S GOING TO FLY FATHER HOME THIS AFTERNOON
cv-valid-test/sample-003638.mp3,I MYSELF HEARD NOTHING OF THAT
cv-valid-test/sample-003639.mp3,IT'S TRUE THAT EVERYTHING HAS ITS DESTINY BUT ONE DAY THAT DESTINY WILL BE REALIZED
cv-valid-test/sample-003640.mp3,THE BOY STOOD UP SHAKILY AND LOOKED ONCE MORE AT THE PYRAMIDS
cv-valid-test/sample-003641.mp3,AND THE SOLID PART WAS CALLED THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE
cv-valid-test/sample-003642.mp3,I'M NOT WORKING FOR ANY OTHER PAPER
cv-valid-test/sample-003643.mp3,IT SEEMED SO SAFE AND TRANQUIL
cv-valid-test/sample-003644.mp3,AND IT KNEW NOTHING ABOUT LOVE
cv-valid-test/sample-003645.mp3,BESIDES THAT THERE WAS A HEAP OF BICYCLES
cv-valid-test/sample-003646.mp3,I HAVE A TAXI WAITING DOWNSTAIRS
cv-valid-test/sample-003647.mp3,YOU'RE JUST LIKE A FATHER YOU USED TO BE
cv-valid-test/sample-003648.mp3,MAKE YOU'RE A HERO SHORT AS YOU'RE BORN
cv-valid-test/sample-003649.mp3,MY SAVINGY RESUMEGAT IS MARKED NOT TRACKS
cv-valid-test/sample-003650.mp3,HAVE TRUSTED MORE IN YOUR LOVE FOR FATIMA
cv-valid-test/sample-003651.mp3,THERE MUST BE A LANGUAGE THAT DOESN'T DEPEND ON WORDS THE BOY THOUGHT
cv-valid-test/sample-003652.mp3,BUT HE DECIDED FIRST TO BUY HIS BERCRO AND PUT SOME MONEY ASIDE
cv-valid-test/sample-003653.mp3,IT'S THE EMERALD TABLET SAID THE ENGLISHMAN PROUD THAT HE MIGHT TEACH SOMETHING TO THE BOY
cv-valid-test/sample-003654.mp3,THE STREAMER OF GAS CAME OUT TOWARDS US
cv-valid-test/sample-003655.mp3,SO HIS HIRD THOUGHT WAS QUIET FOR AN ENTIRE AFTERNOON
cv-valid-test/sample-003656.mp3,THE BOY AND THE ENGLISHMAN HAD BOUGHT CAMELS AND CLIMBED UNCERTAINLY ON TO THEIR BACKS
cv-valid-test/sample-003657.mp3,SOMETIMES I APPEAR IN THE FORM OF A SOLUTION OR A GOOD IDEA
cv-valid-test/sample-003658.mp3,I CAN ALWAYS GO BACK TO BEING A SHEPHERD THE BOY THOUGHT
cv-valid-test/sample-003659.mp3,HE HEARD A MUFFLED GRATING SOUND AND SAW THE BLACK MARK JERK FORWARD AN INCH OR SO
cv-valid-test/sample-003660.mp3,SOMETHING INSIDE THE CYLINDER WAS UNSCREAMING THE TOP
cv-valid-test/sample-003661.mp3,IN SPITE OF THIS I STILL BELIEVED THAT THERE WERE MEN IN MARS
cv-valid-test/sample-003662.mp3,ALL THAT TIME THE MARTIANS MUST HAVE BEEN GETTING READY
cv-valid-test/sample-003663.mp3,THE BOY SAW A MAN APPEAR BEHIND THE COUNTER
cv-valid-test/sample-003664.mp3,THE BOY COULD CERTAINLY RESIST THAT CAUSING THAT KIND OF ANXIETY FOR THE BAKER
cv-valid-test/sample-003665.mp3,HER FATHER'S AWFUL WORRIED ABOUT HER
cv-valid-test/sample-003666.mp3,YOU SHOULD EVALUATE IT IN A PERCEPTIBALE EXPERIMENT
cv-valid-test/sample-003667.mp3,IT SPREAD THROUGH THE PLANET'S ATMOSPHERE AND OBSCURED ITS MORE FAMILIAR FEATURES
cv-valid-test/sample-003668.mp3,THE ENGLISHMAN VENISHED TOO DOWN TO FIND THE ALCHEMIST
cv-valid-test/sample-003669.mp3,MANY OF OUR SOLDIERS TAMED UP
cv-valid-test/sample-003670.mp3,SOME OF THOSE WHO SAW ITS FLIGHT SAY IT TRAVELLED WITH A HISSING SOUND
cv-valid-test/sample-003671.mp3,EVERYONE LOVED THEM AND ENJOYED THEM
cv-valid-test/sample-003672.mp3,THE BOY THOUGHT ABOUT THE CRYSTAL MERCHANT
cv-valid-test/sample-003673.mp3,THERE WAS NO OTHER BAGGAGE
cv-valid-test/sample-003674.mp3,WE ARE REFUGES FROM THE TRIBAL WARS AND WE NEED MONEY THE OTHER FIGURES SAID
cv-valid-test/sample-003675.mp3,IT WAS A TENT LIKE MANY AT THE OASIS
cv-valid-test/sample-003676.mp3,HE DECIDED TO CONCENTRATE ON MORE PRACTICAL MATTERS
cv-valid-test/sample-003677.mp3,DID YOU INVITE HIM TO THE CONCERT
cv-valid-test/sample-003678.mp3,HE AROSE AND TAKING UP HIS CROOK BEGAN TO AWAKEN THE SHEEP THAT STILL SLEPT
cv-valid-test/sample-003679.mp3,THAT NIGHT THERE WAS ANOTHER JETTING OUT OF GAS FROM THE DISTANT PLANET
cv-valid-test/sample-003680.mp3,THE WALLS WERE COVERED WITH THICK PASTE
cv-valid-test/sample-003681.mp3,IT WAS SUCH A GRADUAL MOVEMENT THAT HE FOUND IT ONLY BY NOTICING THE DOTS
cv-valid-test/sample-003682.mp3,WHO TOLD YOU ABOUT OMENS THE BOY'S INTEREST WAS INCREASING BY THE MOMENT
cv-valid-test/sample-003683.mp3,YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE
cv-valid-test/sample-003684.mp3,IN SPITE OF THIS I STILL BELIEVED THAT THERE WERE A MEN IN MARS
cv-valid-test/sample-003685.mp3,MARCH WAS WINDY AND DARK
cv-valid-test/sample-003686.mp3,THEY  THEY TELL THEIR INCROPETAL STORIES AT T THE TIME WHEN YOU WANT TO HELP THEMHERETHEM
cv-valid-test/sample-003687.mp3,THEY BECOME THE SOUL OF THE WORLD
cv-valid-test/sample-003688.mp3,WHAT'S YOUR FIRST NAME
cv-valid-test/sample-003689.mp3,EVEN THOUGH THE SHEEP DIDN'T TEACH ME TO SPEAK ARABIC
cv-valid-test/sample-003690.mp3,CAN I GET A WOOTROOT TO
cv-valid-test/sample-003691.mp3,A CARD HANGING IN THE DOORWAY ANNOUNCED THAT SEVERAL LANGUAGES WERE SPOKEN IN THE SHOP
cv-valid-test/sample-003692.mp3,SOMETHING TERRIBLE'S HAPPENED TO ME
cv-valid-test/sample-003693.mp3,LOOKING THROUGH THE TELESCOPE I SAW A CIRCLE OF DEEP BLUE AND LITTLE ROUND PLANET
cv-valid-test/sample-003694.mp3,IF A PERSON IS LIVING OUT HIS DESTINY HE KNOWS EVERYTHING HE NEEDS TO KNOW
cv-valid-test/sample-003695.mp3,FOR THE BEST PART OF HIS LIFE THE TABLE HAS BEEN STANDING IN THE BASEMENT
cv-valid-test/sample-003696.mp3,BUT I FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO GET TO WORK BECAUSE OF THE INVESTIGATIONS
cv-valid-test/sample-003697.mp3,WHAT ABOUT THIS JOB
cv-valid-test/sample-003698.mp3,THE BOY BECAME FIERCE THE OMENS TOLD HIM THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG
cv-valid-test/sample-003699.mp3,IT WERE HIS TREASURE
cv-valid-test/sample-003700.mp3,IT WOULD HAVE BEEN VISIBLE TODAY HAD I ONLY LOOKED UP AS IT
cv-valid-test/sample-003701.mp3,THE MERICAL INDUSTRY SAVES LIVES
cv-valid-test/sample-003702.mp3,IF I DON'T FIND IT I CAN ALWAYS GO HOME
cv-valid-test/sample-003703.mp3,DON'T YOU KNOW THOT GILL IS VERY SICK
cv-valid-test/sample-003704.mp3,MANY TELESCOPES WERE APOINTED AT IT
cv-valid-test/sample-003705.mp3,SADLY MY DREAM OF BECOMING A SQUIRREL WHISPERER MAY NEVER HAPPEN
cv-valid-test/sample-003706.mp3,NEVER ADVERTISE RAZORS BY SHAVING A MONKEY ITS CRUEL AND RESULTS IN LAWSUITS
cv-valid-test/sample-003707.mp3,WAIT FOR THE END OF THE WAR
cv-valid-test/sample-003708.mp3,THE MEN CLIMBED THE HILL AND THEY WERE TIRED WHEN THEY REACHED THE TOP
cv-valid-test/sample-003709.mp3,WHAT HE SAID REMINDED THE BOY OF THE OLD KING
cv-valid-test/sample-003710.mp3,THEYSTEAD OF RUNNING WILDLY INTO THE TREES
cv-valid-test/sample-003711.mp3,CHATTER BUGS JOHN AND THE CONEL
cv-valid-test/sample-003712.mp3,BUT THE BOY COULDN'T EVEN SPEAK
cv-valid-test/sample-003713.mp3,I'M SMOKING TOO MUCH
cv-valid-test/sample-003714.mp3,JOHN KATHARENE TOPPED THEM ALL
cv-valid-test/sample-003715.mp3,HE HOPED THAT IT WOULD BE SOMEONE AS CAPABLE AS HIS PREVIOUS APPRENTICE
cv-valid-test/sample-003716.mp3,THE BOY NOTICED THAT THE OWNER OF THE BAR STOOD NEAR BY LISTENING ATTENTIVELY TO THEIR CONVERSATION
cv-valid-test/sample-003717.mp3,WHO'S GOT THE ROOM NEXT TO HERS
cv-valid-test/sample-003718.mp3,DOESN'T THAT MAKE SENSE
cv-valid-test/sample-003719.mp3,GIVEN ONLY THE PUBLIC KEY IT IS VERY HARD TO COMPUTE THE PRIVATE ONE
cv-valid-test/sample-003720.mp3,BUT HE STILL COULDN'T FLEE
cv-valid-test/sample-003721.mp3,TO DO THAT SUCCESSFULLY I MUST HAVE NO FEAR OF FAILURE
cv-valid-test/sample-003722.mp3,THAT'S A LOT OF HOOI
cv-valid-test/sample-003723.mp3,TOO BAD YEAS TO BE FED ON A BOTTLE
cv-valid-test/sample-003724.mp3,I WON'T GO IN TO THEM
cv-valid-test/sample-003725.mp3,HE DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING ELSE
cv-valid-test/sample-003726.mp3,BUT THE MARKETPLACE WAS EMPTY AND IT WAS FAR FROM HOME SO HE WHEPT
cv-valid-test/sample-003727.mp3,WE ARE PART OF THAT SOUL SO WE RARELY RECOGNIZE THAT IT IS WORKING FOR US
cv-valid-test/sample-003728.mp3,THEIR HORSES CRIED OUT AND ALL THEIR WEAPONS WERE FILLED WITH SAND
cv-valid-test/sample-003729.mp3,HENDERSON WENT INTO THE RAILWAY STATION TO TELEGRAPH THE NEWS TO LONDON
cv-valid-test/sample-003730.mp3,AND TO DO THAT YOU NEED MONEY
cv-valid-test/sample-003731.mp3,DRINK AND ENJOY YOURSELF SAID THE ALCHEMIST NOTICING THAT THE BOY WAS FEELING HAPPIER
cv-valid-test/sample-003732.mp3,AND AT THAT I TOLD HIM AND HE TOOK MY PLACE
cv-valid-test/sample-003733.mp3,ALFEYUMIS IN EGYPT SAID THE ARAB
cv-valid-test/sample-003734.mp3,WE KNOW THAT AND WE ARE USED TO IT
